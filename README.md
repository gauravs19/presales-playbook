## The Presales Operating System

The role of the modern Sales Engineer has evolved far beyond technical demonstration. In complex B2B enterprise sales, the SE is the linchpin of the revenue engine—required to interface seamlessly with engineering to assess feasibility, while simultaneously navigating the C-suite to establish business value and urgency.

Yet, while Account Executives are trained rigorously on MEDDPICC, Challenger, and Miller Heiman methodologies, Presales professionals are often merely instructed to "master the product." 

**This asymmetry is the root cause of stalled evaluations, heavy discounting, and technical wins that fail to convert to commercial revenue.**

### Beyond Product Mastery
Knowing your platform is the baseline expectation. Elite presales execution requires a deeper competency model:
*   **Commercial Fluency:** Translating API limits and architectural tradeoffs into quantifiable business risk and ROI for the CFO.
*   **Solution Scoping:** Establishing firm boundaries during technical discovery to prevent scope creep and eliminate "free consulting."
*   **Executive Presence:** Controlling the room during high-stakes demonstrations and defending the solution architecture against hostile objections.
*   **Deal Orchestration:** Partnering with sales leadership to align the technical evaluation strategy directly with the prospect's procurement timeline.

### A Practitioner's Playbook
This repository is not a theoretical framework produced by analysts. It is a codified discipline built by Principal Architects and Presales Leaders who actively construct and defend enterprise deals. It documents the exact tactics required to secure the technical win, insulate the deal margin, and accelerate the sales cycle.

## The Graduation Model

The playbook uses a three-tier progression system:

- **Beginner** — No prior presales experience. Covers the "what" and the "how" of the SE role at a foundational level.
- **Mid-Level** — 1–3 years of SE experience. Covers deal strategy, advanced discovery, and commercial influence.
- **Senior** — 3+ years. Covers executive selling, team scaling, product influence, and leadership.

Each section is tagged with its level. Graduation checkpoints between tiers help you self-assess whether you're ready to progress.

## How to Use This Playbook

**Don't read it cover to cover.** This isn't a novel. It's a reference manual with a narrative thread. Use it in three ways:

1. **Sequential learning** — If you're new, work through Sections 0–3 in order. Each builds on the last.
2. **Problem-driven lookup** — If you have a specific challenge (e.g., "how do I handle a hostile CTO in a demo"), navigate directly to the relevant subsection.
3. **Team enablement** — If you're a manager, assign specific sections as pre-reading before deal reviews, SKOs, or onboarding programmes.
