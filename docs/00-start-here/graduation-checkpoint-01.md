#### 0.5 Graduation Checkpoint — New SE to Mid-Level

This is your inflection point. Before you move to Section 1, verify that you've built the foundational habits that everything else depends on. This isn't a test — it's a self-assessment. Be honest. If you can't confidently check most of these boxes, spend more time in this section before moving forward. There's no penalty for thoroughness.

**Knowledge Checkpoints:**

- [ ] I can explain what a Solutions Engineer does in plain language, without product jargon
- [ ] I can name the key roles on both sides of an enterprise deal (AE, Champion, Economic Buyer, Detractor, Procurement)
- [ ] I can define the following terms without looking them up: ARR, ACV, POC, RFP, MEDDPICC, Technical Win, Pipeline, Multi-threading
- [ ] I understand the difference between a 30-day transactional deal and an 18-month enterprise cycle — and how my approach should differ
- [ ] I can name the six most common failure points where enterprise deals die

**Skill Checkpoints:**

- [ ] I have led at least 3 discovery calls independently (with or without a senior SE backup)
- [ ] I have delivered at least 2 customer-facing demos for my top use cases
- [ ] I have built a working demo environment with sample data
- [ ] I have received specific, actionable feedback from a senior SE on at least one live call
- [ ] I have made at least one mistake in a customer meeting, corrected it, and learned from it

**Habit Checkpoints:**

- [ ] I read the CRM before every customer meeting
- [ ] I log technical notes in the CRM within 1 hour of every call
- [ ] I maintain a personal discovery question bank
- [ ] I maintain an objection log
- [ ] I conduct a weekly Monday deal review of my active pipeline
- [ ] I have a "phone-a-friend" senior SE I can call when I'm stuck

**Self-Assessment:**

Rate yourself 1–5 on each of the following:

| Competency | 1 (Struggling) | 3 (Functional) | 5 (Confident) | My Score |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Product knowledge (top 5 use cases) | Can't demo without notes | Can demo with minor hesitation | Can demo and handle unexpected questions | |
| Discovery questioning | Asks generic questions | Asks persona-relevant questions | Digs to root cause and quantifies pain | |
| Meeting presence | Nervous, talks too fast | Composed, adequate pacing | Commands the room with natural authority | |
| AE partnership | Waits for AE instructions | Collaborates on meeting prep | Proactively shapes deal strategy | |
| Time management | Reactive to calendar invites | Prioritises by deal size | Manages portfolio with deliberate allocation | |

**If you score 3+ on at least 4 of these 5 competencies, you're ready for Section 1.**

Section 1 shifts from "How do I do this job?" to "How do I do this job at a level that influences deal outcomes, not just supports them?" The difference is the gap between an SE who executes and an SE who shapes. Everything from here gets harder — and more rewarding.

🟢→🟡 **This checkpoint marks the transition from Beginner to Mid-Level.** From this point forward, the playbook assumes you have working knowledge of the deal lifecycle, the key stakeholders, and the basic presales motions. The training wheels are off.
