#### 0.3.3 Week 6–10: Lead With a Safety Net

You've oriented. You've shadowed. You've absorbed the patterns. Weeks 6–10 are where you take the wheel — but with someone riding shotgun who can grab it if you're about to drive off a cliff. This is the "supervised solo" phase, and it's the most important period in your entire ramp because the habits you form here will define your performance for the next 18 months.

1. **Lead your first discovery call with a senior SE on mute.** Book a discovery meeting on a deal your SE manager considers low-risk. Prepare your discovery questions using the frameworks you've observed. Run the call. Your senior SE sits on the call with camera off and mic muted — available to jump in only if you hit a wall you genuinely cannot navigate. After the call, debrief immediately. Not in 2 hours. Not tomorrow. Immediately, while every micro-decision is still fresh.

2. **Run your first solo demo — but rehearse it three times first.** No SE should deliver a customer demo they haven't rehearsed at least three times internally. Record your rehearsal. Watch it back. Time it. Identify the two weakest transitions and fix them. Your first live demo will be roughly 60% as good as your best rehearsal. That's normal. The rehearsals raise the floor so that 60% is still good enough.

3. **Make your first mistake — and own it publicly.** You will say something wrong in a customer meeting during this phase. You will misquote a spec, overclaim a capability, or fumble a question. When it happens, correct it in writing within 24 hours: "Following up from our call — I want to clarify that the batch processing limit is 500K rows, not 1M as I mentioned. Here's the documentation." This builds more credibility than getting it right in the first place. Customers don't expect perfection. They expect honesty.

4. **Start managing your own deal notes independently.** Stop relying on the AE's summary of what happened. After every call you lead, write your own technical notes in the CRM within 1 hour. Include: architecture discussed, requirements surfaced, unknown items, and agreed next steps. When the AE reads your notes and says, "I didn't catch that detail about their middleware constraint," you've proven your value.

5. **Ask for structured feedback from your AE partners.** After each customer-facing interaction, send a one-line Slack message to the AE: "Quick feedback — what's the one thing I should do differently next time?" This does two things: it signals that you take improvement seriously, and it gives the AE permission to coach you without feeling awkward. AEs who trust their SE's commitment to growth will give them better deals.

> **War Story:** A new SE led her first discovery call. She had prepared 12 questions. She asked the first question, got a detailed 4-minute answer, and then moved straight to question 2 without acknowledging anything the prospect had said. By question 5, the prospect was giving one-word answers. The senior SE messaged her privately: "Echo back what they said before your next question." She started paraphrasing: "So if I understand correctly, the core issue is that your ETL pipeline breaks every time the schema changes — is that right?" The prospect's entire demeanour shifted. "Yes, exactly." The rest of the call was the best discovery conversation the senior SE had heard in months. One coaching note. One real-time adjustment. One completely different outcome.

> **Failure Mode:** The new SE who avoids customer-facing work because they "don't feel ready yet." They stay in the shadowing phase for 3 months, reading documentation and building demo environments nobody asked for. Their manager mistakes quietness for thoroughness. When they finally lead a call, they're paralysed by the gap between what they've studied and what actually happens in a live meeting. The longer you delay leading, the harder the transition becomes. Imperfect action beats perfect preparation.

**Interview Angle:**
"Describe a mistake you made early in your presales career and how you handled it."
A strong answer demonstrates transparency, a specific correction made with the customer, and a process change adopted as a result. A weak answer minimises the mistake or blames circumstances.

**Practical Reference: The First Solo Meeting Readiness Checklist**

- [ ] Discovery questions prepared and rehearsed
- [ ] Demo environment tested and working
- [ ] Pre-meeting CRM review completed
- [ ] Senior SE confirmed as backup on the call
- [ ] AE aligned on meeting objectives and roles
- [ ] Immediate post-call debrief scheduled (15 minutes)
- [ ] CRM technical notes logged within 1 hour

🟢 **Beginner** — The goal of this phase is not perfection. It's *functional independence with a feedback loop*. You should be able to lead a standard discovery and demo by week 10 — imperfectly, but independently.
