#### 0.4.1 The Art of Strategic Shadowing

Most SE teams will tell a new hire to "shadow some calls." What they won't tell you is *how* to shadow effectively. Sitting on a Zoom call with your camera off while checking Slack is not shadowing — it's attendance. Strategic shadowing is a deliberate practice that turns observation into skill acquisition at 3x the speed of passive exposure.

1. **Pick your target wisely.** Not all senior SEs are equally worth shadowing. The SE with the highest win rate might be operating on pure charisma and relationship capital — skills that are hard to reverse-engineer. The SE who wins deals from behind (converting sceptics, navigating complex architectures, recovering from bad demos) teaches you far more useful mechanics. Ask your manager: "Who is the best SE at winning deals that should have been lost?" That's who you shadow first.

2. **Declare your focus before the call.** Tell the senior SE: "I'm specifically watching how you handle technical objections today." This does two things: it forces you to observe with intention, and it gives the senior SE a frame for the post-call debrief. Without a declared focus, you'll try to absorb everything and retain nothing.

3. **Count, don't just watch.** During the call, track quantitative signals: How many questions did the SE ask versus answer? How many seconds of silence followed a hard question? How many times did the SE redirect the conversation versus follow the prospect's lead? These numbers reveal patterns that "it felt like they did well" never will.

4. **Record the pivots, not the scripts.** The most valuable moments in any customer call are the *pivots* — the moments where the conversation went somewhere unexpected and the SE made a real-time decision about how to respond. Did the prospect suddenly ask about a competitor? Did the CTO raise a concern that wasn't in the briefing? How did the SE handle it? These pivot moments are where expertise lives.

5. **Shadow across different AEs, not just different SEs.** The same senior SE behaves differently with different AEs. With a strong AE, they play a supporting role and let the AE drive. With a weak AE, they quietly take control of the meeting flow. Observing the same SE across 3 different AE relationships teaches you adaptability — the most underrated skill in presales.

> **War Story:** A new SE shadowed 15 calls in her first month. She didn't debrief any of them. When asked what she learned, she said, "I saw how the team handles demos and discovery." When pressed for specifics, she couldn't name a single technique, pivot, or decision point. She'd been present for 15+ hours of live presales work and retained almost nothing actionable. Compare that to her peer who shadowed 6 calls, debriefed each one, and could articulate exactly why the senior SE paused for 4 seconds after the CTO said "we're also talking to Snowflake." Six productive shadows beat fifteen passive ones.

> **Failure Mode:** The new SE who only shadows SEs they "click with" personally. They avoid the abrasive-but-brilliant SE who is the best deal closer on the team. They shadow the friendly SE who runs smooth meetings but has a mediocre win rate. They learn to be pleasant. They don't learn to win.

**Interview Angle:**
"What's the most useful thing you've ever learned from watching a more experienced SE work?"
A strong answer identifies a specific technique or decision point and explains how they incorporated it. A weak answer gives a general compliment without specifics.

**Practical Reference: The Shadowing Impact Matrix**
After 10 shadow sessions, categorise your observations:

| Category | Techniques Observed | Applied to My Own Deals? |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Discovery questioning | e.g., "The pause after asking about budget" | Yes — tried it, prospect opened up more |
| Objection handling | e.g., "Validated before redirecting" | Not yet — need to practise |
| Meeting control | e.g., "Agenda-setting in first 2 minutes" | Yes — reduced meeting drift |
| Competitive positioning | e.g., "Never named competitor directly" | Observing more before trying |

🟢 **Beginner** — Strategic shadowing has diminishing returns after about 20 well-debriefed sessions. After that, you learn more from leading than observing. Know when to transition.
