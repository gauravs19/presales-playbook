#### 0.2.2 Short Deals vs. Long Deals — 30 Days to 18 Months

A 30-day SMB deal and an 18-month enterprise procurement exist in the same industry but require completely different muscles. The SE who crushes a transactional mid-market pipeline will drown in a strategic enterprise cycle — and vice versa. Understanding which game you're playing before you play it is the difference between efficient execution and wasted months.

1. **Short-cycle deals (30–90 days)** are volume games. You'll run multiple discoveries and demos per week. The prospect usually has a clear, immediate pain point — their current tool is broken, the contract is expiring, or a new compliance requirement is forcing a change. Decision-making is concentrated in 1–2 people. The SE motion is: diagnose fast, demo fast, close fast. Your biggest risk is spending too much time on any single deal. Over-investing in a $40K deal that should take 3 weeks is the most expensive mistake in transactional presales.

2. **Long-cycle deals (6–18 months)** are strategy games. You might have one or two of these per quarter. The prospect is evaluating a platform-level change that touches multiple departments, requires board approval, and involves a formal procurement process with legal, security, and compliance reviews. Decision-making is distributed across 5–15 stakeholders. The SE motion is: build relationships slowly, multi-thread aggressively, and manage your stamina. Your biggest risk is losing momentum during the "quiet periods" between milestones — the 6 weeks of silence between your POC and the procurement review where the deal appears dead but is actually grinding through internal approvals.

3. **The hybrid deal** — Starts small and grows. A department-level pilot ($50K) that, if successful, expands to an enterprise license ($500K+). These are the most rewarding and most dangerous deals. Rewarding because you get early technical validation. Dangerous because the pilot's success criteria are often disconnected from the enterprise buyer's decision criteria. You can win the pilot brilliantly and still lose the expansion because somebody at the C-suite level decided to go with a "strategic partner" instead.

4. **Time kills deals — differently.** In short cycles, time kills by giving the prospect space to deprioritise. If you don't close a transactional deal in the momentum window, the prospect moves on to the next fire. In long cycles, time kills by introducing new stakeholders, budget shifts, and priority changes. A deal that was #1 priority in Q1 can drop to #5 by Q3 because the CEO attended a conference and got excited about a different initiative.

5. **SE bandwidth allocation must match deal length.** If you have 10 short-cycle deals and 2 long-cycle deals, you should be spending roughly 40% of your time on the 2 enterprise deals and 60% spread across the 10 transactional ones — not evenly distributing your calendar. The enterprise deals will generate 4x the revenue. Staff them accordingly.

> **War Story:** An SE joined from a mid-market team where deals closed in 45 days. She was reassigned to an enterprise account that had been in motion for 8 months. She applied her mid-market playbook — pushing for a demo in week one, following up daily, asking for a decision timeline on every call. The prospect's CTO called the AE and said, "Your SE seems a bit aggressive — we're still 6 months from procurement." She wasn't being aggressive. She was being transactional in a strategic context. The AE had to recalibrate her expectations: in enterprise, patience isn't laziness. It's strategy.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who treats a long-cycle deal like a short-cycle one and burns out the prospect before they're ready to decide. They send weekly check-in emails, request status updates after every internal meeting, and propose additional demos that nobody asked for. The prospect starts avoiding their calls. The champion goes dark — not because they lost interest, but because the SE became exhausting. The deal doesn't die. It just gets handed to a competitor who knows how to play the long game.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you adjust your approach when working a 30-day deal versus a 12-month enterprise cycle?"
A strong answer identifies specific behavioural differences: pacing, depth of discovery, stakeholder strategy, and resource allocation. A weak answer says "the process is the same, just longer."

**Practical Reference: Deal Length Heuristic**
Use these signals to estimate deal length before you invest:

| Signal | Likely Short (< 90 days) | Likely Long (6+ months) |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Buyer type | Department head, individual budget | VP/C-suite, board-approved budget |
| Stakeholders | 1–3 | 5–15+ |
| Procurement | Credit card or standard PO | Formal RFP, legal review, security audit |
| Competitor | Maybe 1 alternative | 3–5 vendors in structured evaluation |
| Your ACV | < $100K | > $250K |

🟢 **Beginner** — At this level, simply recognising which type of deal you're in will prevent the most common pacing errors. As you progress, you'll develop an instinct for when a "short deal" is actually going to become a "long deal" — and how to manage that transition.
