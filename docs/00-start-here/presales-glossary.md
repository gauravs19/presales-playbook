#### 0.1.3 The Presales Glossary — Every Term You'll Hear in Week One

Your first week in presales will feel like everyone around you is speaking a language they assume you already know. Nobody stops to define terms. The AE will say "we need to MEDDPICC this deal" and expect you to nod. The SE manager will ask about your "technical win rate" and expect a number. Your champion will reference "the RFP we're responding to" and assume you've read it.

This glossary is your survival guide. Bookmark it. Refer to it without shame. Every senior SE you admire had a moment when they Googled "what does ARR mean" — they just won't admit it.

**Deal & Pipeline Terms:**

1. **ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)** — The annualised value of a subscription contract. A $120K/year SaaS deal = $120K ARR. This is how your company measures growth and how your AE measures success.

2. **ACV (Annual Contract Value)** — Similar to ARR but includes one-time fees like implementation. A $120K/year subscription + $30K implementation = $150K ACV in year one.

3. **Pipeline** — The total value of all deals currently being worked. An AE might say "I have $4M in pipeline" — meaning $4M worth of deals in various stages of progression. Your pipeline is a leading indicator: too thin and you'll miss quota, too bloated and you're wasting time on deals that won't close.

4. **Technical Win** — The moment the prospect's technical team confirms your solution meets their requirements. This is your primary deliverable as an SE. It typically happens after a successful POC or a particularly strong discovery-into-demo sequence.

5. **Closed-Won / Closed-Lost** — The final disposition of a deal. Closed-Won means the contract was signed. Closed-Lost means the prospect chose a competitor, chose no solution, or the deal died for any reason. Both outcomes are valuable learning opportunities.

**Methodology & Qualification Terms:**

1. **MEDDPICC** — Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Process, Decision Criteria, Paper Process, Identified Pain, Champion, Competition. The most widely used enterprise sales qualification framework. As an SE, you'll primarily contribute to Metrics (quantifying pain), Decision Criteria (shaping evaluation), Identified Pain (surfacing it in discovery), and Competition (understanding who you're up against).

2. **BANT** — Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline. An older, simpler qualification framework. Still useful for quick gut-checks: does this prospect have money, can they decide, do they need what we sell, and when?

3. **Discovery** — The diagnostic conversation where you uncover the prospect's current pain, existing architecture, business impact, and requirements. This is arguably the single most important skill in presales. Bad discovery leads to bad demos, bad POCs, and lost deals.

4. **Champion** — An internal advocate at the prospect's organisation who actively wants your solution to win and is willing to spend political capital to make it happen. A deal without a champion is a deal without a pulse.

5. **Multi-threading** — Building relationships with multiple stakeholders at the prospect to reduce single-point-of-failure risk. If your only contact leaves, gets promoted, or goes dark, a multi-threaded deal survives. A single-threaded deal dies.

**Technical Presales Terms:**

1. **POC (Proof of Concept)** — A structured technical evaluation where the prospect tests your product against agreed success criteria. A POC is your highest-investment, highest-risk presales activity. It typically takes 2–6 weeks and consumes significant SE bandwidth.

2. **RFP (Request for Proposal)** — A formal document issued by a prospect inviting vendors to submit a detailed proposal. RFPs range from 20 questions to 2,000 questions. Not all are worth responding to — and knowing which to decline is a critical skill.

3. **Harbor Tour** — A product demo that walks through every feature in sequence, like a guided tour of a harbor. This is the worst possible demo format. It bores the audience, fails to connect to their specific pain, and hands the initiative to whoever asks the first tangential question.

4. **Technical Debt** — Existing architectural shortcuts or legacy decisions in the prospect's environment that will complicate your integration. Discovering technical debt early saves you from building a POC on quicksand.

5. **As-Is / To-Be Architecture** — The prospect's current state (as-is) versus the proposed future state with your solution (to-be). Your solution design is essentially the bridge between these two diagrams.

> **War Story:** An SE joined a discovery call and heard the AE say "we need to get to paper by end of quarter." The SE didn't know what "get to paper" meant (it means getting a contract in front of the legal team for signature). They spent the next two weeks preparing a detailed technical document instead of helping accelerate the procurement process. The deal slipped a quarter. One undefined term. Six figures of delayed revenue.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who nods along when they don't understand a term because they're afraid of looking junior. This compounds day after day until they're operating on assumptions that diverge further and further from reality. Six weeks in, they discover they've been building a POC against requirements that were actually "nice-to-haves" the prospect mentioned once in passing — because they didn't understand what "MoSCoW prioritisation" meant when the evaluator referenced it.

**Interview Angle:**
"What does a 'technical win' mean to you, and how do you know when you've achieved one?"
A strong answer describes a formal or semi-formal declaration from the prospect's technical team, ideally documented and shared with the economic buyer. A weak answer says "when the demo goes well."
