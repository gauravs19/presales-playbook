#### 0.3.2 Week 3–6: Shadow Before You Lead

By week three, the temptation to "do real work" becomes overwhelming. The AEs are sending you calendar invites. Your manager is asking when you'll be "ramped." Your ego is telling you that you've seen enough to fly solo. Resist it — at least partially. Weeks 3–6 are your apprenticeship phase. You shadow with intent, debrief with rigour, and make your first controlled contributions.

1. **Shadow with a specific focus per call.** Don't just sit on calls passively. Before each shadowed meeting, pick one thing to observe. Monday: watch how the senior SE opens a discovery call. Wednesday: watch how they handle an objection about missing features. Friday: watch how they transition from the demo to next steps. Passive observation teaches nothing. Targeted observation teaches everything.

2. **Run the "invisible debrief."** After every shadowed call, spend 10 minutes writing down: What did the SE do well? What would I have done differently? What question did the prospect ask that I couldn't have answered? Share your debrief notes with the senior SE and ask for their reaction. This single practice will accelerate your ramp by 40% because it forces you to engage analytically with what you observed, not just absorb it passively.

3. **Take your first "section" of a call.** Around week 4, ask the senior SE if you can run one specific section of a customer call — typically the product overview or a single use-case walkthrough. Not the full demo. Not discovery. One contained, rehearsed segment that you've practised three times internally. This is your controlled exposure. If it goes well, you build confidence. If it stumbles, the senior SE is there to recover.

4. **Build your first persona-mapped demo narrative.** Take one of the top 5 use cases and build a 15-minute demo script around a specific persona. Not "here's how feature X works." Instead: "You're a data engineering manager at a mid-market fintech. Your team spends 3 hours every morning manually reconciling yesterday's transactions. Here's how that changes." Personas make features stick. Practice this narrative until you can deliver it without notes.

5. **Start logging your "I don't know" list.** Every question you encounter that you can't answer goes on a list. Not to memorise the answer — to understand *the pattern* of questions that matter. After 4 weeks, your list will cluster around 3–4 themes: integration, security, scalability, and pricing. Those clusters become your study priorities for weeks 6–10.

> **War Story:** A new SE shadowed a senior colleague on a complex discovery call. The prospect's lead architect asked about database failover behaviour during a regional outage. The senior SE answered confidently and moved on. In the debrief, the new SE said, "I noticed you didn't mention that our failover takes 90 seconds, not the 30 seconds you implied." The senior SE paused and said, "You're right. I rounded down because the architect's concern was about data loss, not speed. If I'd said 90 seconds, he would have fixated on the number instead of hearing that zero data is lost." The new SE learned more about presales communication from that single exchange than from any training module.

> **Failure Mode:** The new SE who shadows for 6 weeks and never debriefs. They sit on 30 calls, absorb 30% of what happened, and when they're finally asked to lead a meeting, they replicate the senior SE's style but not the substance. They mimic the tonality without understanding the decision-making underneath. They sound confident until the first unexpected question, at which point they freeze because they never processed *why* the senior SE said what they said.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a time you learned a critical skill by observing another SE. What did you observe and what did you take from it?"
A strong answer identifies a specific behaviour or decision, explains the reasoning behind it, and describes how it changed their own approach. A weak answer says "I learned a lot from watching senior people."

**Practical Reference: The Shadow Call Debrief Template**

| Call Date | Prospect | Senior SE | My Focus Area |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| | | | e.g., "how they handled the pricing question" |

**Post-Call Notes:**
- What did the SE do well?
- What would I have done differently?
- What question came up that I couldn't answer?
- Key takeaway for my own practice:

🟢 **Beginner** — Shadowing without debriefing is just sitting in meetings. The debrief is where the learning happens. Make it a non-negotiable habit in this phase.
