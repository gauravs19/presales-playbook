#### 0.1.2 The Cast of Characters — Who Does What in a Deal

Walk into any enterprise deal and you'll find the same cast of characters on both sides of the table. The problem is, nobody gives you a programme when you join. You're expected to figure out who matters, who's dangerous, and who's just filling a seat — usually while the meeting is already underway.

Here's your cast list. Learn it before your first call.

**Your Side of the Table:**

1. **The Account Executive (AE)** — Owns the commercial relationship. Responsible for pipeline generation, deal progression, and contract negotiation. The AE's primary metric is closed revenue. They are your closest partner and, occasionally, your most dangerous liability. A great AE clears the path so you can run. A bad AE blocks the path and expects you to bulldoze through it anyway.

2. **The Solutions Engineer (SE) — That's You** — Owns the technical win. Responsible for discovery, solution design, demonstrations, proof of concepts, and technical credibility. You are the person the prospect's engineers trust (or don't). Everything covered in this playbook is your domain.

3. **The SE Manager / Director of Solutions** — Your direct leadership. Sets coverage models, manages SE-to-AE ratios, tracks technical win rates, and advocates for headcount. In healthy organisations, this person shields you from low-quality deals and fights for your time. In dysfunctional ones, they just forward AE requests to your calendar.

4. **The Sales Development Representative (SDR/BDR)** — Generates initial meetings through outbound prospecting. By the time a deal reaches you, the SDR has typically qualified it at a surface level. Their qualification is often shallow — they confirmed the prospect is willing to take a meeting, not that the prospect has budget, authority, or a real problem. Expect to re-qualify.

5. **Professional Services / Implementation** — The team that builds what you sold. Your solution design becomes their implementation spec. If you over-promise during the sales cycle, these are the people who suffer. Build a relationship with your PS lead early — they'll tell you what's actually deployable and what's a fantasy.

**The Prospect's Side of the Table:**

1. **The Champion** — The internal advocate who wants your solution to win. They're usually a mid-to-senior manager who has a personal stake in solving the problem you address. Your champion will give you insider information, coach you on internal politics, and fight for your solution in rooms you'll never enter. Lose your champion, lose the deal.

2. **The Economic Buyer** — The person who can sign the cheque. Often a VP, SVP, or CxO. They care about business outcomes, risk, and ROI — not your API throughput. You may never meet them directly. When you do, you get 15 minutes, not 60. Make every sentence count.

3. **The Technical Evaluator** — A senior engineer, architect, or IT director tasked with validating your solution technically. They will test your claims. They will find your gaps. They are not your enemy — they are your credibility checkpoint. Win their respect and they become your strongest advocate. Lose it and no amount of AE charm will save the deal.

4. **The Detractor** — Someone on the prospect's side who does not want you to win. Maybe they built the legacy system you're replacing. Maybe they prefer a competitor. Maybe they're protecting their team's headcount. Detractors operate quietly — they raise concerns in meetings you're not invited to, they add requirements designed to disqualify you, they slow procurement to a crawl. You must identify them early and decide whether to convert, neutralise, or navigate around them.

5. **Procurement** — The team responsible for vendor evaluation, contract negotiation, and compliance. They are not your enemy, but they are not your friend either. Their job is to reduce your price and increase your legal exposure. Treat them with respect and prepare for their process — it's the single biggest cause of deal delays in enterprise sales.

> **War Story:** An SE joined a deal three months in. Nobody briefed them on the cast. In the first technical deep-dive, they treated the "quiet person in the corner" as a junior attendee and directed all answers to the loud engineering manager. The quiet person was the CTO. The CTO decided in that meeting that the SE lacked judgement. The deal closed — with a competitor. Always ask the AE before every meeting: *who is in the room and what do they care about?*

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who builds a relationship exclusively with the champion and ignores the economic buyer. The champion gets promoted, moves to a different department, or leaves the company. The deal has no executive sponsorship. It stalls and dies in procurement. You invested four months of technical work for nothing.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a deal where you had to navigate a hostile stakeholder. How did you identify them, and what did you do?"
A strong answer demonstrates early detection, a deliberate engagement strategy, and an outcome tied to the deal result. A weak answer describes getting blindsided or "winning them over with a great demo."

**Practical Reference: The Pre-Meeting Cast Sheet**
Before every customer-facing meeting, fill out this 4-row sheet:

| Name | Title | Role in Deal | What They Care About | Risk Level |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
|      |       | Champion / Evaluator / Buyer / Detractor / Unknown | Business outcome / Technical validation / Political cover / Cost reduction |  Low / Med / High |

Share this with your AE before the meeting. Update it after every interaction.

🟢 **Beginner** — At this level, simply knowing the roles exist is the win. As you progress, you'll learn to read the room in real time and adapt your messaging per persona without preparation.
