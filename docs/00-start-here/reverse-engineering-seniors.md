#### 0.4.3 Reverse-Engineering a Senior SE's Deal Approach

The best presales education isn't in a training module. It's in the historical record of deals that skilled SEs have already won and lost. Every closed deal is a case study. Every lost deal is a post-mortem. And most of this intelligence is sitting in your CRM, in recorded calls, and in Slack threads — unread and unanalysed by anyone except the SE who lived through it.

Here's how to reverse-engineer a senior SE's approach systematically:

1. **Pick 3 closed-won deals and read the full CRM history.** Choose deals from the senior SE whose approach you most want to learn. Read every activity log, every note, every email attachment. Map the timeline: when did discovery happen? How many meetings before the demo? Was there a POC? How long was negotiation? You're looking for the *sequencing* of their approach, not just the content.

2. **Listen to their recorded calls.** If your company uses Gong, Chorus, or any call recording platform, go back and listen to 3–4 key calls from a successful deal. Listen for: how they open (do they start with an agenda or a question?), how they respond to objections (validate first or counter immediately?), and how they close (firm next step or open-ended?). Take timestamped notes on specific techniques.

3. **Map their stakeholder engagement pattern.** In the CRM, check how many different people the senior SE engaged. Did they meet only with the engineering team, or did they also engage the business sponsor? Did they request a separate session with the security team? The breadth of their engagement tells you whether they're a single-threaded or multi-threaded operator.

4. **Identify the deal's inflection point.** Every won deal has a moment where it shifted from "maybe" to "probably." It might be a successful POC checkpoint, a key objection that was resolved, or a meeting with the economic buyer that the champion arranged. Find that moment. Understanding *what caused the shift* is the highest-value insight in deal analysis.

5. **Compare with a closed-lost deal from the same SE.** Now pick a deal the same SE lost. Run the same analysis. Where did they deviate from their usual pattern? Was discovery shallower? Were fewer stakeholders engaged? Was the inflection point missing? Comparing wins and losses from the same SE reveals their success formula more clearly than studying wins alone.

> **War Story:** A new SE reverse-engineered 5 deals from the team's top closer. She noticed a pattern nobody had articulated: in every closed-won deal, the senior SE had a separate, off-calendar conversation with the prospect's IT operations lead — not the architect, not the engineering manager, but the person responsible for running the system after deployment. In every closed-lost deal, this conversation never happened. The operations lead was the silent stakeholder who could block procurement with a single "I don't feel comfortable supporting this." The senior SE had never formalised this step. It was instinct. The new SE formalised it, added "Operations Stakeholder Conversation" to her personal discovery checklist, and improved her first-year win rate by 12 percentage points.

> **Failure Mode:** The new SE who tries to replicate a senior SE's style instead of their structure. They mimic the confident delivery, the casual humour, the authoritative tone — but they skip the preparation, the stakeholder mapping, and the post-call follow-up that the senior SE does invisibly behind the scenes. They become a convincing performer who loses deals because the substance isn't there.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you learn from deals that other SEs on your team have closed?"
A strong answer describes a systematic approach — CRM review, call recording analysis, pattern extraction. A weak answer says "we have team meetings where we share updates."

**Practical Reference: The Deal Reverse-Engineering Worksheet**

For each deal studied:
- **Deal ID / Prospect Name:**
- **SE Who Ran It:**
- **Outcome:** Won / Lost
- **Timeline:** First meeting → Close (or loss) — how many weeks?
- **Number of Stakeholders Engaged:**
- **Key Inflection Point:**
- **Pattern Match:** Does this deal follow the same pattern as their other wins?
- **One Technique to Adopt:**

🟢 **Beginner** — Reverse-engineering deals is the closest thing to a time machine in presales. You can compress 3 years of experience into 3 months by studying the right deals with the right lens.
