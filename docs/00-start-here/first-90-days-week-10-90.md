#### 0.3.4 Week 10–90: Build Your Personal Operating System

By week 10, you're no longer the new SE. You're a functioning member of the team. You're running discovery calls, delivering demos, and logging CRM notes. The safety net is mostly gone. What separates SEs who plateau at "functional" from those who accelerate to "exceptional" is what happens in weeks 10–90: the construction of a personal operating system.

A personal operating system is the set of habits, templates, and rituals that make your presales execution repeatable, scalable, and improvable. Without one, every deal is a fresh start. With one, every deal builds on the last.

1. **Build your personal demo library.** Record yourself delivering each of your top 5 use-case demos. Watch them back quarterly. Identify what's getting sharper and what still needs work. Store your best demo recordings as benchmarks — when you have a rough week, watching yourself at your best recalibrates your confidence.

2. **Create your discovery question bank.** After 10+ discovery calls, you'll notice patterns. Certain questions consistently unlock valuable information. Others consistently produce vague or defensive answers. Curate the winners. Organise them by persona (engineer vs. VP vs. CFO) and by topic (architecture, pain, budget, timeline). This bank becomes your pre-call preparation accelerator.

3. **Establish your weekly deal review rhythm.** Every Monday morning, spend 30 minutes reviewing your active deals. For each deal, answer: What's the next step? What's the biggest risk? What have I not done yet? This prevents deals from going dark because you got distracted by a flashier opportunity. The worst feeling in presales is opening your pipeline on Friday and realising you haven't touched a deal in 3 weeks.

4. **Start an objection log.** Every time a prospect raises an objection you haven't heard before, write it down along with how you handled it (or failed to handle it). Over time, this log becomes a personal playbook of battle-tested responses. After 6 months, you'll have 30–50 entries. After a year, you'll rarely encounter an objection you haven't already thought through.

5. **Track your personal metrics.** Don't wait for your manager to tell you your win rate. Calculate it yourself monthly. How many demos did I deliver? How many progressed to POC? How many POCs resulted in technical wins? If your demo-to-POC conversion is 60% but your POC-to-win rate is only 30%, you have a POC execution problem, not a demo problem. Self-awareness drives self-improvement.

> **War Story:** An SE built a ruthlessly simple operating system in her first 90 days: a Monday deal review, a Friday objection log update, and a monthly metric self-assessment. Her manager noticed that her win rate climbed from 22% in Q1 to 38% in Q2 — not because she got dramatically better at demoing, but because she started declining poorly qualified deals (discovery question bank revealed weak signals) and investing her POC energy in deals with confirmed champions (deal review rhythm surfaced single-threaded risks early). She was promoted to Senior SE within 14 months. The operating system was the differentiator.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who treats every deal as a unique event with no connection to the last one. They never capture patterns, never review their objection handling, never track their own metrics. After 12 months, they've "done 80 demos" but have the pattern recognition of someone who's done 8 — because they never processed the experiences into reusable knowledge. They're busy. They're not improving.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you track and improve your own performance as an SE?"
A strong answer describes a specific, self-directed system — metrics tracking, objection logs, demo recording reviews, or weekly deal reviews. A weak answer says "my manager tracks our team metrics in the CRM."

**Practical Reference: The SE Personal Operating System Template**

| Ritual | Frequency | Time | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|------|---------|
| Deal portfolio review | Weekly (Monday) | 30 min | Identify at-risk deals, prioritise actions |
| Objection log update | Weekly (Friday) | 15 min | Capture and process new objections |
| Demo self-recording review | Monthly | 45 min | Benchmark personal demo quality |
| Metric self-assessment | Monthly | 20 min | Track demo-to-POC, POC-to-win, cycle length |
| Discovery question bank refresh | Quarterly | 30 min | Add winners, retire weak questions |

Total weekly time investment: ~1.5 hours. ROI: career-defining.

🟢 **Beginner** — The operating system doesn't have to be perfect. It has to exist. A rough system you follow consistently beats a beautiful system you abandon after two weeks.
