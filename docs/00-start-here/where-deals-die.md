#### 0.2.3 Where Deals Die — The Six Most Common Failure Points

Deals don't usually die in a dramatic explosion. They die quietly — a missed follow-up, an unasked question, a stakeholder who was never engaged. The SE who understands where deals die can prevent those deaths before they happen. This is preventative medicine, not emergency surgery.

Here are the six failure points that kill more enterprise deals than any competitor ever could:

1. **Death by Poor Discovery.** The SE runs a surface-level discovery, accepts the prospect's stated requirements at face value, and builds a demo around symptoms rather than root causes. The demo looks fine but doesn't resonate because it's solving a problem the prospect didn't actually prioritise. The prospect says "impressive technology, not sure it's the right fit." What they mean is: "You didn't understand our real problem." This is the most common and most preventable failure in presales. Roughly 60% of lost deals can be traced back to insufficient discovery.

2. **Death by No Champion.** The SE and AE engage with willing participants who attend meetings, ask questions, and seem enthusiastic — but none of them are willing to fight for the deal internally. Without a champion who will navigate internal politics, build the business case, and push procurement, the deal sits in "evaluation" permanently. The telltale sign: nobody at the prospect's organisation is proactively scheduling next steps. If you're always the one proposing the next meeting, you probably don't have a champion.

3. **Death by Single-Threading.** The entire deal relationship runs through one person on the prospect's side. That person changes roles, goes on leave, or loses influence. The deal has no other relationships to sustain it. Within two weeks, the new contact "wants to re-evaluate from scratch." You've just lost 3 months of work because you didn't build a second bridge.

4. **Death by Late Security Surprise.** The deal progresses beautifully through discovery, demo, and POC. The technical win is declared. Then procurement sends a 400-question security questionnaire that reveals a data residency requirement you can't meet, or an encryption standard you don't support, or an integration with a GRC platform you've never heard of. The deal is frozen for 8 weeks while your security team scrambles. The competitor, who surfaced these questions in discovery, has already submitted their answers. They close. You don't.

5. **Death by Internal Champion Overload.** This is the opposite of "no champion." Your champion is *too* enthusiastic and takes on the entire internal selling burden themselves. They burn out. They face political resistance they didn't anticipate. They can't get a meeting with the economic buyer. The deal stalls because your champion ran out of organizational energy, and you never helped them share the load. Elite SEs don't just find champions — they coach champions, arm them with talking points, and help them distribute the internal selling effort.

6. **Death by Procurement Attrition.** The technical decision is made. Everyone agrees your solution is the best fit. But the contract sits in procurement for 4 months. Approvals are needed from legal, compliance, data protection, and finance — each with a 2-week SLA that nobody enforces. During those 4 months, the competitor calls the economic buyer and offers a 30% discount. Your deal doesn't die because the technology failed. It dies because the commercial process took so long that someone blinked.

> **War Story:** An SE ran a flawless POC. The prospect's engineering team wrote an internal report recommending her product unanimously. The champion forwarded the report to the VP of Engineering. The VP never read it. The champion assumed he had. Four months later, the VP chose a competitor based on a recommendation from a peer at another company. The champion called the AE in disbelief: "But we won the technical evaluation." They did. They lost the political evaluation. The SE never mapped the VP as a stakeholder because the champion kept saying "don't worry, he'll sign whatever I recommend." He didn't.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who completes a beautiful demo and declares "my job is done, it's in the AE's hands now." They move on to the next deal while the current one bleeds out slowly in procurement. When the deal is marked Closed-Lost three months later, the SE is genuinely surprised. They don't connect their absence in the post-demo phase to the outcome because nobody taught them that deals are won or lost in the follow-through, not the performance.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a deal you lost and what you would do differently now."
A strong answer identifies a specific failure point, takes ownership of what they could have influenced, and describes a process change they adopted as a result. A weak answer blames the AE, the product, or the prospect.

**Practical Reference: The Deal Health Pulse Check**
Run this weekly on every active deal:

| Question | Healthy | At Risk |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Do we have an identified champion? | Yes, they're scheduling next steps | No, or they've gone quiet |
| Are we multi-threaded? | 3+ active contacts | 1 contact |
| Has security been discussed? | Yes, requirements documented | Not yet raised |
| Is there a mutual close plan? | Yes, shared timeline exists | No, dates are vague |
| Is the economic buyer aware? | Yes, briefed by champion | Unknown or not engaged |

If 3 or more answers are "At Risk," the deal needs intervention this week — not next month.

🟢 **Beginner** — Knowing where deals die doesn't prevent every death. But it makes you the SE who asks the uncomfortable questions early — which is the SE who saves the most deals.
