#### 0.2.1 The Full Deal Journey — From First Call to Closed Contract

Every enterprise deal follows the same rough arc, and yet most new SEs have never seen the full journey mapped end-to-end. They get dropped into the middle of a cycle — "join this demo Thursday" — with no concept of what came before or what needs to happen after. That's like joining a relay race at the third leg without knowing where the finish line is.

Here is the full deal journey. Not every deal will follow every stage. Some will skip stages, loop back, or stall indefinitely. But this is the structural blueprint you need to carry in your head.

1. **Lead Generation & Initial Qualification (SDR → AE)** — An SDR or inbound marketing effort generates a lead. The AE has an initial conversation to determine whether it's worth pursuing. At this point, you usually don't exist yet in the prospect's world. The AE is asking: is there pain, is there budget, is there a timeline? If the answers are sufficiently promising, the AE requests SE involvement.

2. **Discovery (SE-Led)** — Your first direct interaction with the prospect. This is where you diagnose the real problem, map the existing environment, identify stakeholders, and quantify the business impact of inaction. Discovery is the most underinvested stage in most sales organisations — and the stage that determines everything that follows. Botch discovery, and every subsequent stage will miss the mark.

3. **Solution Design (SE-Led)** — Based on what you learned in discovery, you architect a solution that maps your product's capabilities to the prospect's specific pain. This is not a generic "here's what our product does" exercise. It's a bespoke answer to "here's what your world looks like today, and here's what it could look like with us."

4. **Demonstration (SE-Led)** — You present the solution to the prospect's team, typically through a live product demo, a guided sandbox, or a combination. The demo is not a feature tour. It's a narrative that shows the prospect their own problem being solved in real time.

5. **Proof of Concept (SE-Led)** — If the prospect needs to validate the solution in their own environment, you build and execute a POC. This is the most resource-intensive stage. It typically takes 2–6 weeks and involves daily interactions with the prospect's technical team. The POC ends with a formal technical win — or it doesn't.

6. **Proposal & Commercial Negotiation (AE-Led, SE-Supported)** — The AE presents the commercial proposal, including pricing, licensing, implementation scope, and terms. You support by ensuring the technical scope is accurate, the architecture documents are complete, and any technical objections from procurement or legal are addressed.

7. **Procurement & Legal Review (AE-Led, SE-Supported)** — The prospect's procurement team reviews the contract, negotiates terms, and requests security documentation. This stage can take 2 weeks or 6 months depending on the organisation. Your role is to complete security questionnaires, participate in technical reviews, and prevent deal-killing surprises.

8. **Closed-Won (or Closed-Lost)** — The contract is signed — or it isn't. Either way, the deal is over. In a well-run presales org, both outcomes trigger a debrief. What worked? What didn't? What intelligence can be extracted for the next deal?

> **War Story:** A mid-market SE assumed the deal was over after a successful demo. The prospect said "this looks great, we'll be in touch." The AE was happy. The SE moved on to other deals. Three weeks of silence. The AE followed up — radio silence. What happened? The prospect's procurement team had flagged a data sovereignty concern that nobody had discussed. The deal died in legal review. If the SE had proactively surfaced the sovereignty question during discovery, the deal would have closed. One unasked question, one dead deal.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who only shows up for discovery and demo, then disappears. They treat the deal as "AE's problem" once the technical work is done. But deals don't close in the demo — they close in the weeks that follow, when procurement sends a 200-question security questionnaire and the legal team red-lines the data processing agreement. If the SE isn't available to respond quickly, the deal loses momentum and competitors fill the vacuum.

**Interview Angle:**
"Walk me through the lifecycle of a typical enterprise deal and where the SE adds the most value."
A strong answer covers the full cycle and emphasises discovery, solution design, and POC as SE-led stages. A weak answer focuses exclusively on the demo.

**Practical Reference: The Deal Stage Tracker**
Maintain a personal log for each active deal:

| Stage | Status | My Key Deliverable | Blocker / Risk | Next Action |
|-------|--------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Discovery | Complete | Pain quantified at $380K/yr | InfoSec requirements not yet surfaced | Schedule security-focused follow-up |
| Demo | Scheduled | Persona-mapped narrative built | CTO not confirmed as attendee | Ask champion to confirm CTO attendance |

🟢 **Beginner** — Knowing the full journey means knowing when to invest your energy and when to hold back. The fastest way to burn out in presales is treating every stage with equal intensity.
