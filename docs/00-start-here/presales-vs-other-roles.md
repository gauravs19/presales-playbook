#### 0.1.4 How Presales Differs From Engineering, Support & Consulting

If you came from software engineering, your instinct is to build the perfect solution. If you came from customer support, your instinct is to fix the immediate problem. If you came from consulting, your instinct is to scope a 6-month engagement with a 40-page statement of work. All three instincts will get you into trouble in presales.

Presales occupies a unique space. You need enough technical depth to be credible, enough commercial awareness to be strategic, and enough emotional intelligence to read a room full of people who aren't telling you what they actually think. No other function in a technology company demands all three simultaneously, under time pressure, with millions of dollars on the line.

Here's how presales compares to the roles you might be coming from:

1. **Engineering builds. Presales proves.** An engineer's job ends when the code is deployed and the tests pass. An SE's job ends when a sceptical architect says, "Okay, I believe this will work in our environment." Engineers have days or weeks to iterate. You have 60 minutes in a demo to earn credibility or lose it permanently. An engineer can ship a fix. You can't un-say a claim you made on a recorded call.

2. **Support reacts. Presales anticipates.** A support engineer receives a ticket describing a problem that already exists. An SE receives a calendar invite to a meeting where the problem hasn't been fully articulated yet — and might not be the real problem at all. Support solves known issues. Presales diagnoses unknown ones. The diagnostic skill (knowing which questions to ask before anyone asks you anything) is the fundamental presales muscle.

3. **Consulting scopes. Presales sells.** A consultant arrives after the contract is signed and has weeks to ramp up. An SE arrives before the contract exists and has one meeting to demonstrate value. Consultants scope projects for thoroughness. SEs scope solutions for winnability — the minimum viable architecture that proves the concept and earns the technical win, not the 18-month digital transformation plan that's technically superior but impossible to sell into a Q4 budget freeze.

4. **Engineering optimises for correctness. Presales optimises for conviction.** An engineer who says "it depends on the configuration parameters" is being accurate. An SE who says the same thing in front of a CFO is being useless. Your job is to provide enough precision to be credible and enough simplicity to be understood. The CFO doesn't need to know about your microservices architecture. They need to know that you'll eliminate 3 hours of manual reconciliation every day and save them $400K a year.

5. **Support is measured on resolution time. Presales is measured on deal outcomes.** If a support engineer resolves a ticket in 4 hours, they've done a great job regardless of the customer's revenue value. If an SE spends 4 weeks on a POC and the deal is lost, they've contributed nothing to the business — no matter how elegant their technical work was. Presales is a results business. The quality of your work is ultimately judged by whether the prospect signs the contract.

> **War Story:** A former platform engineer joined a presales team. In his first demo, a prospect asked about data replication latency. He spent 12 minutes explaining the internal message queue architecture, including partition strategies, consumer groups, and exactly how the acknowledgement protocol handled edge cases. The prospect's VP of Operations — who had asked the original question — picked up his phone and started reading emails. The AE had to physically interrupt to redirect the conversation. The engineer's answer was technically flawless. It was also the moment the prospect mentally disengaged from the evaluation. Three months of pipeline, gone in twelve minutes of unnecessary depth.

> **Failure Mode:** The former consultant who over-scopes every solution. They produce 30-page architecture documents for a Stage 2 deal. They propose 6-month implementation timelines when the competitor is proposing 6 weeks. They design the perfect solution instead of the winnable solution. Their technical work is consistently excellent and their close rate is consistently terrible. They keep blaming AEs for "not selling it properly" instead of recognising that the scope itself is what's killing the deals.

**Interview Angle:**
"How does your approach to problem-solving differ in presales compared to your previous engineering (or consulting or support) role?"
A strong answer demonstrates awareness of the *time compression*, the *commercial context*, and the shift from *building* to *proving*. A weak answer says "it's basically the same, I just present instead of code."

**Practical Reference: The Presales Translation Filter**
Before every customer interaction, run your planned content through this filter:

| If You're Thinking | Say This Instead | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Let me explain how the architecture works" | "Let me show you why this matters for your team's daily workflow" | Prospects buy outcomes, not architecture |
| "We should scope a proper assessment first" | "Here's what we can prove in the next 2 weeks" | Speed wins deals. Thoroughness wins engagements — after the deal closes |
| "The answer is 'it depends'" | "In environments like yours, the typical answer is X. Let me validate the specifics afterward" | Confidence builds trust. Caveats build doubt |
| "I need to check with engineering" | "I'll confirm the exact spec by tomorrow. Based on similar deployments, I expect Y" | Show judgement now. Deliver precision later |

🟢 **Beginner** — Understanding what presales is *not* is as important as understanding what it is. The faster you shed your previous role's reflexes, the faster you'll develop the presales instinct: diagnose fast, prove credibly, close decisively.
