#### 0.3.1 Week 1–2: Orient Before You Operate

The fastest way to fail in a new SE role is to try to add value too quickly. You're hired for your potential and your adjacent experience. You are not yet hired for your judgement — that takes time to build in context. Your first two weeks should be spent absorbing, not performing.

Here's your orientation protocol:

1. **Map the product landscape.** Don't try to learn every feature. Instead, learn the *five use cases* that close the most deals. Ask your SE manager or a senior SE: "What are the top five things we demo most often, and why do customers buy?" These five use cases will cover 80% of your first-quarter activity. Learn them cold. Everything else can wait.

2. **Read the last 10 closed-won deals.** Open the CRM and read the activity history of 10 recently closed deals. For each one, note: what was the prospect's pain, what did we demo, did we do a POC, how long was the cycle, and who was the champion? This gives you pattern recognition faster than any training deck ever could. You're looking for the *shape* of a successful deal, not the details.

3. **Meet every function, not just sales.** Schedule 30-minute coffee chats with one person from each adjacent team: Product, Engineering, Professional Services, Customer Success, Marketing. Ask each of them: "What does presales do well here, and what frustrates you about working with the SE team?" The answers will tell you more about your company's presales culture than your manager ever will.

4. **Identify your "phone-a-friend."** Find one senior SE who is willing to answer your questions without judgement. This is not your manager — it's a peer who remembers what it felt like to be new. Ask them: "If you could go back to your first month, what would you wish someone told you?" Then actually listen to the answer.

5. **Set up your demo environment.** Before you shadow a single call, get your demo instance running, configured, and loaded with sample data. Nothing is worse than getting asked to "jump in and show them the workflow" on day 10 and having nothing to show. Even if it's rough, having a working environment builds your confidence faster than studying documentation.

> **War Story:** A new SE spent his entire first week reading product documentation — 400 pages of technical specs, API references, and release notes. By day 5, he could answer any trivia question about the platform. On day 8, he shadowed a discovery call. The prospect asked, "How would you solve our data reconciliation problem between SAP and Snowflake?" He had no idea. He knew every feature but had never mapped a feature to a real business problem. He'd studied the menu instead of learning to cook.

> **Failure Mode:** The new SE who tries to "prove themselves" by volunteering to lead a demo in week one. They don't know the product well enough to recover from an unexpected question. They don't know the prospect's context well enough to tell a relevant story. The demo goes poorly, the AE loses confidence, and the SE spends the next month trying to rebuild trust internally. First impressions with AEs are hard to reverse.

**Interview Angle:**
"Describe how you onboarded into your last presales role. What did you prioritise in the first two weeks?"
A strong answer shows intentional orientation — product learning, deal history review, relationship building — without rushing to perform. A weak answer says "I just jumped into deals immediately."

**Practical Reference: The Week 1–2 Orientation Checklist**

- [ ] Identified the top 5 use cases that close deals
- [ ] Read 10 closed-won deal histories in CRM
- [ ] Met 1 person from Product, Engineering, PS, CS, Marketing
- [ ] Found a "phone-a-friend" senior SE
- [ ] Demo environment running with sample data
- [ ] Shadowed at least 2 customer calls (observation only)
- [ ] Documented 5 questions to ask my manager at our first 1:1

🟢 **Beginner** — Orientation is about building mental models, not memorising facts. The SE who understands *why* customers buy will always outperform the SE who only knows *what* the product does.
