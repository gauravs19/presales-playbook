#### 0.4.2 How to Ask for Feedback Without Being Dismissed

Senior SEs are busy. They're running their own deals, preparing for demos, writing POC criteria, and fighting for bandwidth. When a new SE walks up and asks, "Do you have any feedback for me?", the answer will always be "you're doing great, keep it up." That's not feedback. That's a polite dismissal because you asked a question that requires too much effort to answer properly.

Learning to *extract* useful feedback from busy experts is a meta-skill that will serve you for your entire career.

1. **Be specific in your ask.** Never ask "do you have feedback?" Instead, ask: "In the demo I ran yesterday, I noticed the prospect went quiet after I showed the reporting module. Did I lose them? What would you have done differently in that segment?" Specific questions get specific answers. Vague questions get vague answers.

2. **Make it easy to say something critical.** Senior SEs don't want to crush your confidence, so they default to positive feedback. Lower the barrier by framing your ask as: "If you had to pick one thing I should stop doing in customer calls, what would it be?" The word "one" makes it manageable. The word "stop" gives them permission to be critical without feeling like they're attacking you.

3. **Time it right.** Immediately after a customer call — within 5 minutes — is the best time to ask for feedback. The call is still fresh. Specific moments are still in memory. If you wait until the weekly team meeting, the details have faded and you'll get generic advice instead of tactical coaching.

4. **Act on it visibly.** If a senior SE tells you to "slow down your demo transitions," make a visible effort in the next meeting to slow down — and then tell them: "I consciously paused between sections today because of your feedback. Did it land better?" This closes the feedback loop and signals that their time investment was worthwhile. They'll give you better feedback next time because they know it actually gets used.

5. **Don't argue with feedback.** When someone tells you that your discovery was too surface-level, your instinct will be to defend: "But the prospect wasn't giving me detailed answers." Resist that instinct. Say: "That's fair. What question would you have asked to go deeper?" Feedback is a gift, even when it stings. Arguing with it ensures you'll never receive it again.

> **War Story:** A new SE asked their mentor, "How's my demo?" The mentor said, "It's good, you know the product well." Three months later, the same SE asked a different question: "I watched the recording of my demo from Tuesday. At minute 8, I showed three features back-to-back without connecting any of them to the prospect's stated pain. Would you have stopped after the first feature and asked a checking question?" The mentor's face lit up. They spent 20 minutes breaking down demo pacing, checking questions, and how to create "micro-confirmations" throughout a presentation. The quality of the question determined the quality of the answer.

> **Failure Mode:** The new SE who receives critical feedback and never asks that person again. They felt embarrassed when a senior SE said "your discovery questions were too leading — you were telling the prospect what their problem is instead of letting them tell you." Instead of processing the feedback and adjusting, they avoided that SE and started asking a friendlier colleague who only ever said "you're doing great." Their discovery skills never improved. They hit a wall at month 6 and couldn't figure out why.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you seek and process constructive criticism?"
A strong answer demonstrates a proactive, specific feedback-seeking habit and gives an example of feedback that changed their behaviour. A weak answer says "I'm always open to feedback" without a specific example.

**Practical Reference: The Feedback Request Template**
Use this structure every time you ask for feedback:

*"Hey [Name], quick feedback request from [specific meeting/demo]. At [specific moment], I [specific action]. I'm not sure it landed well because [specific observation]. If you were in my position, what would you have done differently at that moment?"*

This structure works because it shows you've already reflected, reduces the senior SE's effort, and focuses on a single actionable moment.

🟢 **Beginner** — The quality of feedback you receive is directly proportional to the quality of the question you ask. Invest in your questions.
