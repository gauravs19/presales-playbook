# Shadowing the Prospect's IT Staff

During a POC, the SE has a unique opportunity that no amount of discovery calls can replicate: direct access to the prospect's engineering team in their natural working environment.

Shadowing the prospect's IT staff during the evaluation is the most underutilized intelligence-gathering technique in enterprise presales. While the prospect evaluates your software, you should be evaluating their infrastructure, workflows, and pain points.

## What You're Looking For

### 1. Technical Debt Signals
Watch how the prospect's team interacts with their current systems. Are they using manual workarounds? Do they curse at a specific tool during the standup? Is there a script running on someone's desktop that "nobody is supposed to touch"?

These are gold mines. Every manual workaround is a feature of your platform waiting to be mapped to a use case.

### 2. Political Dynamics
Observe the team dynamics during standups and working sessions:
*   Who does the team defer to on technical decisions? (This person may be a hidden decision-maker you haven't identified.)
*   Who is skeptical of your platform? (This person is your biggest risk—and your biggest opportunity if you can convert them.)
*   Who is the prospect's champion telling you they report to? Is that person actually in charge, or is there a shadow power structure?

### 3. Integration Landscape
Look at the tools on their screens. What monitoring dashboards are open? What Slack channels are they in? What Jira boards are they tracking? This gives you a real-time view of their technology stack—far more accurate than what they told you during discovery.

### 4. The "Real" Problem
Often, the stated problem in the RFP or discovery call is not the real problem. The prospect says they need "better analytics." But when you shadow their team, you discover they spend 4 hours per day manually exporting data from one system and importing it into another. The real problem is data integration, not analytics.

## How to Shadow Without Being Creepy

You cannot simply sit in the corner and take notes. You must position yourself as a collaborative resource.

> *"While the sandbox is running your data load test, would it be helpful if I sat with your data engineering team to understand how they currently handle the ETL pipeline? That way, if we move to implementation, I can make sure the transition is seamless."*

You just earned 2 hours of direct access to their engineering team under the guise of "helping with the transition."

> **War Story:** During a 14-day POC for an observability platform, an SE spent time shadowing the prospect's DevOps team. While watching them work, the SE noticed they had 3 separate monitoring tools open simultaneously—Datadog for APM, PagerDuty for alerting, and a custom Grafana dashboard for infrastructure. The SE asked: "How much time does your team spend switching between these three tools?" The answer: "About 2 hours per day per engineer." The SE built a unified monitoring demo within the POC sandbox that consolidated all three views. The prospect's DevOps lead became the strongest internal champion because the SE solved a pain point nobody had even articulated during discovery.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Isolated SE." This SE sets up the POC sandbox, sends login credentials, and waits for the prospect to test independently. They never observe how the prospect's team actually works, never identify hidden pain points, and never build the personal relationships that create internal champions. Their POC is technically correct but emotionally vacant.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you gather intelligence during a POC beyond the formal success criteria?"
A strong answer is: "I actively shadow the prospect's IT team during the evaluation. I observe their existing workflows, identify manual workarounds, note the tools on their screens, and listen for pain points they haven't formally articulated. In one POC, this approach helped me identify a 2-hour daily productivity drain that wasn't in the original requirements. Solving it converted the prospect's DevOps lead into our strongest champion."

🔴 **Senior-Level** — The POC is not just an evaluation of your software. It is your only chance to see the prospect's world from the inside.
