# Handing Off to the AE After the Technical Win

The moment the Technical Win is declared, the SE's role fundamentally changes. You are no longer the protagonist of the deal. The AE is.

The most common mistake senior SEs make is staying too involved in the commercial negotiation after the Technical Win. When the SE continues to attend every call, answer every prospect email, and drive the conversation, two things happen:

1. The prospect bypasses the AE and negotiates directly with the SE (who has no commercial authority and will accidentally give away concessions).
2. The AE feels undermined and stops driving the deal, assuming the SE "has it covered."

## The Handoff Protocol

### Step 1: The Internal Debrief (30 Minutes)
Immediately after the Technical Win is declared, the SE and AE conduct a private debrief covering:

*   **What was proven:** A summary of the scorecard results.
*   **What wasn't proven:** Any gaps, caveats, or limitations discovered during the POC.
*   **Hidden objections:** Technical concerns the prospect's team raised privately that the AE needs to address commercially (e.g., "They're worried about the cost of the premium tier").
*   **Competitive intelligence:** What the SE learned about the competitor's evaluation (if any).
*   **Recommended next steps:** What the SE believes the AE should push for commercially.

### Step 2: The "Champion Email"
The SE sends a post-POC summary email to the prospect's technical champion, cc'ing the AE. The email:

1. Recaps the scorecard results (all criteria passed).
2. Thanks the champion for their time and participation.
3. Explicitly introduces the AE as the primary contact for next steps: "I'm handing you over to [AE Name] to discuss the commercial framework and implementation timeline."

### Step 3: The SE Steps Back (But Stays Available)
After the handoff email, the SE should:
*   **Stop attending** weekly deal update calls unless the AE specifically requests technical support.
*   **Stop responding** directly to prospect emails. Forward them to the AE and let the AE decide if the SE needs to be involved.
*   **Stay available** for specific technical questions during procurement, legal, or security review stages.

## When the SE Must Re-Engage

There are exactly three scenarios where the SE should re-enter the deal after the Technical Win:

1. **The prospect raises a new technical objection** that the AE cannot address (e.g., "Our InfoSec team has concerns about your data residency in the EU").
2. **The deal enters a competitive bake-off** and the prospect wants a head-to-head technical comparison.
3. **The executive sponsor requests a technical briefing** before approving the budget.

In all other situations, the AE drives. The SE supports.

> **War Story:** A senior SE stayed deeply involved in a $300k deal after the Technical Win because they had built a strong relationship with the prospect's CTO. During a pricing discussion, the CTO casually asked the SE: "Can you throw in the Advanced Analytics module? I know it's a separate SKU, but you've been so helpful." The SE, wanting to maintain the relationship, said: "I'll see what I can do." The AE later found out the SE had verbally committed to including a $40k module for free. The deal closed, but with a 25% margin reduction that the AE got blamed for.

> **Failure Mode:** "The SE Who Can't Let Go." This SE treats every deal as their personal baby. They refuse to hand off to the AE, attend every call, and drive every conversation. The AE becomes a spectator in their own deal. When the contract stalls in procurement, neither the SE nor the AE owns the relationship—and the deal dies in the gap.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you manage the transition from technical evaluation to commercial negotiation?"
A strong answer is: "After the Technical Win, I conduct a private debrief with the AE covering what was proven, what gaps exist, and any competitive intelligence I gathered. I then send a formal handoff email to the prospect introducing the AE as the primary contact for commercial discussions. I step back from day-to-day involvement but remain available for specific technical escalations during procurement or legal review."

🟡 **Mid-Level** — The Technical Win is your exit, not your encore. Hand off cleanly so the AE can do their job.
