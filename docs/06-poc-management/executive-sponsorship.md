# Securing Executive Sponsorship for the POC

A POC without executive sponsorship is a science experiment. It might produce interesting results, but nobody with budget authority will ever see them.

The technical evaluator loves your platform. Their manager thinks it's promising. But neither of them can sign a $200k purchase order. The VP of Engineering or CIO can—and they have no idea the evaluation is happening.

## Why Executive Sponsorship Is Non-Negotiable

### The Approval Chain Reality
In enterprise organizations, technical evaluations are initiated by mid-level engineers, but purchase decisions are approved by executives 2-3 levels above them. If the executive has not been briefed on the POC, they will ask one question when the purchase request lands on their desk: "Why am I hearing about this for the first time?"

That single question kills deals. The executive feels ambushed, questions their team's judgment, and delays the approval while they conduct their own independent review.

### The Champion vs. The Sponsor
*   **Champion:** The technical evaluator who runs the POC, loves your product, and advocates internally. They have influence but no budget authority.
*   **Executive Sponsor:** The VP/CIO/CTO who controls the budget and can approve the purchase. They may never touch your product, but they control the money.

Your job is to ensure the Executive Sponsor is aware of and aligned with the POC *before* it begins.

## How to Secure Executive Sponsorship

### Step 1: Ask the Champion Directly
During the initial discovery call, ask:

> *"Who in your organization would ultimately approve the budget for a solution like this? And have they been briefed on this evaluation?"*

If the champion says "my VP" but hasn't briefed the VP, you must pause the POC until the VP is looped in.

### Step 2: Offer to Facilitate a "Kickoff Briefing"
Position a 15-minute executive briefing as a standard part of your evaluation process:

> *"Before we kick off the technical evaluation, we typically schedule a 15-minute alignment call with your executive sponsor. The goal isn't to sell—it's to ensure our evaluation criteria map directly to the business outcomes your leadership cares about. That way, when we deliver the results, there's no gap between what we proved and what gets approved."*

### Step 3: Tie the POC Criteria to Executive OKRs
If you can align the POC success criteria to the executive's stated objectives (e.g., "Reduce infrastructure costs by 20%" or "Achieve SOC 2 compliance by Q3"), the executive becomes personally invested in the outcome.

> **War Story:** An SE completed a technically perfect POC for a data analytics platform. The technical evaluator—a Senior Data Engineer—was ready to buy. When the purchase request reached the VP of Data, the VP asked: "Why do we need another analytics tool? We already have Tableau." The SE had never spoken to the VP. The VP had never seen a demo, understood the use case, or been briefed on the ROI. The deal stalled for 4 months while the VP conducted their own evaluation. By the time the VP was convinced, the company had entered a budget freeze.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Bottom-Up Only Seller." This SE builds incredible technical rapport with individual contributors and mid-level managers but never engages the executive layer. Their POCs are technically flawless but commercially dead on arrival because no one with budget authority has been involved in the evaluation process.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you ensure that your technical evaluations translate into purchased contracts?"
A strong answer is: "I always identify the executive sponsor before starting a POC. I ask the champion directly: 'Who approves the budget for this?' If the executive hasn't been briefed, I request a 15-minute kickoff alignment call to connect the POC success criteria to the executive's business objectives. This ensures that when the POC succeeds, the executive already understands the value and can approve the budget without a separate discovery process."

🔴 **Senior-Level** — A POC without executive sponsorship is a hobby project. Secure the sponsor before you provision the sandbox.
