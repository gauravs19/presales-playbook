# Paid vs. Free POC

The default operating model for most SaaS vendors is to offer free Proofs of Concept. This is a catastrophic strategic error that trains prospects to extract unlimited free labor from your presales team.

A free POC communicates one thing to the prospect: your time has no value. If your engineering resources are free, your software must not be worth much either.

## When to Demand a Paid POC

A paid POC is appropriate when any of the following conditions are true:

1. **The POC requires significant SE time (>40 hours).** If the prospect is demanding a production-replica sandbox, custom data ingestion, or a multi-week evaluation with daily standups, they are consuming consulting-grade resources. Consulting-grade resources cost money.
2. **The prospect has no validated budget.** If the AE cannot confirm that the prospect has allocated budget for this purchase, a paid POC forces the prospect to prove financial commitment. Prospects who refuse to pay even $10k for a structured POC almost never sign a $200k contract.
3. **The deal involves a new market vertical.** If your company is entering Healthcare, Government, or Financial Services for the first time, the POC will require custom compliance work (HIPAA, FedRAMP, SOC 2 scoping). This is paid professional work, not free presales.

## How to Position the Paid POC

Never frame the paid POC as a cost. Frame it as risk mitigation for the prospect.

      <strong>Elite SE</strong>
      "Given the complexity of your environment—specifically the legacy SAP integration and the multi-region data residency requirement—a standard 14-day evaluation won't give your team enough time to validate the architecture properly. What we recommend is a structured 30-day Proof of Value, jointly staffed by our Solutions Architecture team and your IT leads. The investment is $15,000, which is fully credited toward the annual subscription if you proceed to contract."

The "fully credited toward the subscription" clause is critical. It eliminates the prospect's objection that they are "paying for a demo." They are pre-paying for software they intend to buy.

## The Free POC Exception

Free POCs are acceptable in exactly one scenario: when the deal is strategically critical for your company's market positioning (e.g., a Fortune 50 logo that unlocks an entire vertical), *and* the VP of Sales has explicitly authorized the resource investment.

If the VP didn't approve it, it's not strategic—it's just free consulting.

> **War Story:** An SE team ran a free 45-day POC for a mid-market logistics company. The SE dedicated 120 hours to building custom dashboards, data connectors, and a production-ready sandbox. At the end of the POC, the prospect said: "This was incredibly helpful. We've decided to build it in-house using your architecture as a reference. Thanks!" The SE had just provided $50k worth of free consulting to a company that never intended to buy.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Free Consulting Factory." The SE team runs 8 free POCs per quarter, each consuming 40-80 hours. Only 1 converts to a paid contract. The other 7 prospects extracted free architecture design, free data migration testing, and free integration validation—then either built it themselves or used the SE's work as leverage to negotiate a discount with a competitor.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you evaluate whether a POC should be paid or free?"
A strong answer is: "I assess three factors: the estimated SE hours required, whether the prospect has validated budget, and the strategic importance of the logo. If the POC exceeds 40 hours and the prospect hasn't confirmed budget, I recommend a paid POC with the fee credited toward the subscription. This filters out tire-kickers and ensures the prospect has genuine purchase intent."

🔴 **Senior-Level** — Free POCs attract tire-kickers. Paid POCs attract buyers. The fee is a filter, not a barrier.
