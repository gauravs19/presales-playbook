# Diagnosing and Rescuing a Stalled POC

A stalled POC is not a passive state—it is an active signal that something fundamental has broken in the evaluation. The prospect hasn't said "No," but they've stopped saying "Yes." Standups are getting cancelled. Data access requests go unanswered. The champion is slow to respond.

If you do not intervene within 48 hours of the first stall indicator, the POC will die.

## The 5 Root Causes of a Stalled POC

### 1. The Champion Lost Internal Support
The person who initiated the evaluation has been overruled, reassigned, or deprioritized by their manager. They are too embarrassed to tell you directly.

**Diagnosis Signal:** The champion stops attending standups but sends a junior team member who has no context on the evaluation.

**Rescue Action:** Ask the champion directly: *"Is there anything that has changed internally that I should be aware of? I want to make sure we're aligned with your leadership's current priorities."*

### 2. A Competitor Impressed Them More
The prospect is running a parallel evaluation with a competitor. The competitor had a stronger demo or offered a lower price. The prospect is now leaning toward the competitor but hasn't officially told you.

**Diagnosis Signal:** The prospect starts asking highly specific questions that sound like they came from a competitor's SE (e.g., "Does your platform support [Competitor's proprietary feature name]?").

**Rescue Action:** Address the competitive dynamic directly: *"It sounds like you may be comparing our approach to a specific alternative architecture. Can you share what you're seeing from other vendors so I can provide a direct technical comparison?"*

### 3. The Data/Environment Is Broken
The prospect's own staging environment has failed, their data is dirty, or they can't provision the access needed for the POC. They're stalling because they're embarrassed about their internal infrastructure.

**Diagnosis Signal:** Repeated excuses about "waiting for IT to provision access" or "the data isn't ready yet."

**Rescue Action:** Offer to use your synthetic data set instead: *"To keep us on track, I can pre-load a synthetic data set that mirrors your schema. This lets us prove the core capabilities on time while your team resolves the staging access in parallel."*

### 4. Budget Was Never Real
The prospect was "exploring" without confirmed budget. Now that the evaluation is producing results, they realize they can't actually buy—and they're too polite to tell you.

**Diagnosis Signal:** The AE cannot get a meeting with the executive sponsor. The prospect deflects all budget conversations with "we'll figure that out after the POC."

**Rescue Action:** Force the issue: *"Before we invest another week in the evaluation, I want to align on the commercial timeline. Has budget been formally allocated for this initiative, or are we building the case for a future budget request?"*

### 5. The POC Simply Isn't Impressive
Sometimes, the stall is your fault. The POC is failing to demonstrate enough value. The prospect expected to be blown away and was merely satisfied.

**Diagnosis Signal:** The prospect scores your criteria as "Pass" but their energy is flat. No enthusiasm, no internal advocacy, no forward-leaning questions.

**Rescue Action:** Deploy the "Aha Moment" play—identify one dramatic, unexpected capability that the prospect hasn't seen yet and demonstrate it live.

> **War Story:** An SE noticed Day 8 standups being cancelled and the champion going dark. Instead of sending follow-up emails, the SE called the champion directly and asked: "Level with me—what changed?" The champion admitted that their VP had redirected the team to a different priority project and the evaluation was deprioritized. The SE immediately pivoted: "Can I get 15 minutes with your VP? If I can show them how this evaluation directly accelerates the priority project, we might be able to keep both initiatives alive." The VP took the call, the SE repositioned the POC around the new priority, and the deal closed 6 weeks later.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Patient Waiter." This SE notices the POC stalling but continues sending polite follow-up emails: "Hi, just checking in!" "Any update on the staging access?" "Let me know when your team is ready." They wait passively for 4-6 weeks, then mark the deal as "Closed Lost — No Decision." They never diagnosed the root cause.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a time a POC or evaluation stalled. How did you handle it?"
A strong answer is: "I noticed standups being cancelled and the champion going unresponsive. Instead of sending follow-up emails, I called them directly and asked what changed. They told me their VP had reprioritized. I requested 15 minutes with the VP, repositioned our evaluation around the new corporate priority, and ultimately closed the deal. The key was diagnosing the root cause immediately instead of waiting passively."

🔴 **Senior-Level** — A stalled POC is a diagnosis problem, not a patience problem. Identify the root cause within 48 hours or kill the deal.
