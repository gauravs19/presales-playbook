# Declaring the Technical Win

The Technical Win is the moment the prospect's technical evaluator formally acknowledges that your platform meets all of the pre-defined success criteria. It is the most important milestone in the presales cycle because it is the bridge between technical validation and commercial commitment.

A Technical Win that is not explicitly declared is worthless. The SE must force a binary verdict.

## What a Technical Win Is NOT

### It Is Not "They Liked the Demo"
A positive demo gets you a meeting. A Technical Win gets you a contract.

### It Is Not "They Said Nice Things"
"Impressive platform" and "Really slick interface" are compliments, not commitments. A Technical Win requires the prospect to say: "Yes, this meets our requirements and we are ready to move to commercial discussions."

### It Is Not Implied
If the prospect completes the POC and says nothing negative, you do not have a Technical Win. Silence is not a verdict.

## How to Force the Declaration

At the conclusion of the POC, schedule a formal "Technical Review" meeting. The attendees must include:
*   The prospect's technical evaluator (minimum)
*   The prospect's technical evaluator's manager (ideal)
*   The AE
*   The SE

### The Script

Walk through the Pass/Fail Scorecard line by line. After confirming each criterion passed, ask the decisive question:

> *"Based on the results your team has recorded across all [5] success criteria, do we have your team's recommendation to move forward? In other words—do we have a Technical Win?"*

If they say **Yes:** Immediately transition to commercial next steps. The AE takes over. The SE schedules the internal handoff debrief.

If they say **"Yes, but...":** Probe the "but." There is a residual concern. Address it on the spot or schedule a focused follow-up within 48 hours. Do not let the "but" go unresolved.

If they say **"We need more time":** This is not a neutral response. It is a soft No. Ask: "What specific criteria remain unproven, and what would it take to prove them in the next 5 business days?" If they cannot answer specifically, the Technical Win is in serious jeopardy.

## The Technical Win Email

After the verbal declaration, immediately send a confirmation email:

> **Subject:** Technical Win Confirmed — [Your Platform] + [Prospect Company]
>
> Hi [Champion],
>
> Thank you for confirming today that [Your Platform] has met all success criteria as defined in our evaluation agreement. To recap:
>
> ✅ [Criterion 1] — Passed
> ✅ [Criterion 2] — Passed
> ✅ [Criterion 3] — Passed
> ✅ [Criterion 4] — Passed
> ✅ [Criterion 5] — Passed
>
> As discussed, [AE Name] will be reaching out to align on the commercial framework and implementation timeline.
>
> Thank you for your team's time and participation during this evaluation.

This email serves as a written record that the prospect acknowledged the Technical Win. If the prospect later tries to reopen the evaluation or claim "we never said it was a win," you have documentation.

> **War Story:** An SE completed a POC where all 5 criteria were met. The prospect's team was enthusiastic. But the SE never formally asked for the Technical Win—they assumed it was obvious. Three weeks later, the prospect's VP asked: "Has our team formally recommended this platform?" The champion said: "Well, the POC went well, but we never made an official decision." The evaluation was reopened, a competitor was invited, and the SE lost the deal 4 months later in a bake-off that should never have happened.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Assumed Win." This SE delivers a flawless POC but never explicitly asks for the Technical Win. They tell the AE "we won" based on positive vibes and compliments. When the AE tries to advance the commercial negotiation, the prospect says: "We're still evaluating." The SE is shocked. The deal enters a zombie state.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you close out a POC and transition to the commercial phase?"
A strong answer is: "I schedule a formal Technical Review meeting at the end of every POC. I walk through the Pass/Fail Scorecard with the prospect's evaluator and their manager, then explicitly ask: 'Do we have a Technical Win?' If yes, I send a confirmation email documenting the results and immediately hand off to the AE. If there's hesitation, I probe for the specific unresolved concern and address it within 48 hours."

🟡 **Mid-Level** — A Technical Win that is not explicitly declared does not exist. Ask the question. Get the answer. Document it.
