# The POC You Should Refuse

Not every POC is worth running. Some evaluations are designed to extract free consulting, validate a decision that has already been made, or satisfy a procurement checkbox exercise where you are the designated loser.

Learning to refuse a POC is one of the most valuable commercial skills an SE can develop.

## The 5 POCs You Must Refuse

### 1. The "Column Fodder" POC
The prospect has already selected a vendor. Procurement requires three evaluations. You are Vendor B or Vendor C, invited only to satisfy the process.

**Red Flags:**
*   The prospect cannot articulate why they are evaluating *your* platform specifically.
*   The success criteria suspiciously match a competitor's exact feature set.
*   You have zero access to the executive sponsor.

### 2. The "Free Consulting" POC
The prospect has no intention of buying. They want your SE team to design their architecture for free, validate their internal assumptions, or train their junior engineers on modern design patterns.

**Red Flags:**
*   The prospect's questions are more educational than evaluative ("Can you explain how event-driven architectures work?").
*   They request access to your full documentation library before agreeing to any commercial terms.
*   The POC scope keeps expanding but the prospect refuses to discuss pricing.

### 3. The "No Budget" POC
The prospect genuinely likes your platform but has not secured budget. They want to run the POC first and "use the results to request budget." This almost never works. Budget requests take 1-2 quarters. Your POC results will be stale by then.

**Red Flags:**
*   The champion says: "If the POC goes well, I can take this to my VP to get funding."
*   There is no compelling event or hard deadline.

### 4. The "Infinite Scope" POC
The prospect wants to test everything—15 integrations, 6 data sources, 3 user personas—in a 14-day window. This is not a POC; it is a full implementation project disguised as an evaluation.

**Red Flags:**
*   The success criteria document has more than 10 requirements.
*   The prospect's team cannot prioritize which 3 capabilities matter most.

### 5. The "Ghost Champion" POC
Your champion—the person who initiated the evaluation—has gone silent. They are not responding to emails, not attending standups, and not providing the data access you need. This means they have either lost internal political support, been reassigned, or simply lost interest.

**Red Flags:**
*   Two or more missed standups without explanation.
*   Data or environment access requests unanswered for more than 5 business days.

## How to Refuse Gracefully

> *"Based on our assessment, we don't believe the current evaluation framework will produce a conclusive result for your team. Specifically, [cite the missing pre-condition]. Rather than invest time in an evaluation that may not lead to a clear outcome, we'd recommend we address [budget validation / executive alignment / scope definition] first. Once those are in place, we're confident we can deliver a high-impact evaluation within [14] days."*

> **War Story:** An SE Manager refused a POC request from a Fortune 500 retailer because the AE could not confirm budget or executive sponsorship. The AE was furious—"This is a Fortune 500 logo!" Three months later, the same retailer came back with a confirmed budget, a named executive sponsor, and a 30-day timeline tied to a contract expiry. The SE team ran the POC in 14 days and closed a $400k deal. The refusal forced the prospect to get serious.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Yes-to-Everything SE Manager." This manager approves every POC request to avoid conflict with sales. The SE team runs 12 POCs per quarter, wins 1, and loses 11. The SEs are exhausted, demoralized, and the best ones leave for companies that respect their time.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a time you refused to run a POC. What happened?"
A strong answer is: "I declined a POC for a prospect that had no confirmed budget and no executive sponsor. The AE was initially frustrated, but I explained that running the POC without those pre-conditions would waste 60 hours of SE time on a deal with a sub-10% close probability. Three months later, the prospect returned with both items in place, and we won the deal."

🔴 **Senior-Level** — The POCs you refuse define your win rate more than the POCs you run.
