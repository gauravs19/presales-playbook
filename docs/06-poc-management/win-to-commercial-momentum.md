# Converting the Technical Win to Commercial Momentum

The Technical Win is not the finish line—it is the starting pistol for the commercial race. The 48 hours immediately following the Technical Win declaration are the most critical window in the entire deal cycle.

If you allow momentum to die after the Technical Win, the deal enters a dangerous drift. The prospect's enthusiasm fades, their attention shifts to other priorities, and the urgency to buy evaporates.

## The 48-Hour Momentum Window

### Hour 0-2: Send the Technical Win Email
Document the Technical Win in writing (see "Declaring the Technical Win"). CC the AE and the prospect's executive sponsor (if accessible). This email creates urgency because the executive now knows a decision point has been reached.

### Hour 2-4: AE Sends the Commercial Framework
Within 4 hours of the Technical Win email, the AE should send the prospect a high-level commercial proposal or pricing summary. This is not the full 40-page proposal—it is a 2-page document that says: "Here is what the solution costs and here is the proposed timeline."

The speed of this follow-up signals to the prospect that your team is organized, professional, and ready to execute. Delays signal disorganization.

### Hour 4-24: Schedule the Executive Meeting
The AE (with SE support) should request a meeting with the prospect's executive sponsor to present the business case and ROI model. This meeting must happen within 7 business days of the Technical Win.

### Hour 24-48: Initiate the Mutual Close Plan
Within 48 hours, the AE and SE should present the Mutual Close Plan to the prospect's champion, mapping every milestone from Technical Win to signed contract.

## Why Momentum Dies

### Reason 1: The SE Disappears
The SE declares the Technical Win and immediately moves to their next POC. The AE is left without technical support to answer the prospect's follow-up questions. The prospect feels abandoned.

### Reason 2: The AE Waits for Procurement
The AE assumes that the next step is "waiting for procurement to reach out." This is passive selling. Procurement will not reach out. The AE must proactively initiate the commercial conversation.

### Reason 3: The Proposal Is Not Ready
The AE and SE have not prepared the commercial proposal in advance. It takes 2 weeks to assemble the pricing, the architecture summary, the security posture appendix, and the executive letter. By the time the proposal is ready, the prospect's enthusiasm has cooled.

## Pre-Building the Proposal

Elite SE teams pre-build 80% of the proposal *during* the POC, not after it. While the evaluation is running, the SE should be drafting:

*   The architecture summary (based on what was proven during the POC)
*   The Time-to-Value milestones
*   The Security Posture appendix
*   The Executive Letter (in collaboration with the AE)

This way, the moment the Technical Win is declared, the proposal is 90% complete. Final pricing is added within hours, and the commercial proposal is delivered the same day.

> **War Story:** An SE team won a Technical Win on a Thursday afternoon. By Friday morning, the AE had sent a 2-page commercial summary. By Tuesday, the full proposal was delivered with an Executive Letter referencing the exact POC results. The prospect's VP was so impressed by the speed and professionalism that she approved the budget in 48 hours—before any competitor could even schedule a follow-up meeting. The deal closed in 18 days from Technical Win to signed contract.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Technical Win Celebration." The SE and AE celebrate the Technical Win and then take 3 weeks to produce the proposal. By the time the proposal arrives, the prospect's champion has been pulled onto another project, the executive sponsor has forgotten the evaluation, and the competitor has used the gap to schedule a "re-evaluation" demo. The deal slips by a full quarter.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you maintain deal velocity after a Technical Win?"
A strong answer is: "I pre-build 80% of the proposal during the POC so it's ready to send within hours of the Technical Win. The AE sends the commercial summary the same day, and we present the Mutual Close Plan within 48 hours. I've found that the 48-hour window after the Technical Win is the most critical moment in the deal cycle—if you don't capitalize on it, momentum evaporates."

🔴 **Senior-Level** — The Technical Win is a lit fuse. The commercial proposal must land before the fire goes out.
