# Getting Legal Sign-Off on the Criteria Document

Most SEs treat the POC success criteria as an informal agreement—a slide deck or an email thread. This is a mistake that costs deals.

If the success criteria are not formally documented and acknowledged by both parties *before* the POC begins, the prospect can retroactively redefine what "success" means after the evaluation is complete.

## Why Legal Sign-Off Matters

Without a signed criteria document, you are vulnerable to two devastating scenarios:

### Scenario 1: The Moving Goalposts
The prospect agreed verbally that "successful data ingestion within 60 minutes" was the criterion. After you achieve it, they say: "Actually, we also need real-time streaming. The batch ingestion doesn't fully meet our needs." You passed the test they gave you, but they changed the test.

### Scenario 2: The Zombie POC
The POC ends successfully. All criteria are met. The prospect says: "Great work. We'll get back to you." Six months later, they haven't made a decision. Without a written commitment to enter commercial negotiations post-success, you have no leverage to force a timeline.

## The Criteria Document Structure

The criteria document should be a 1-2 page formal document (not an email) that includes:

1. **Evaluation Objectives:** A brief statement of the business problem being solved.
2. **Success Criteria (3-5 max):** Each criterion must be measurable and binary (Pass/Fail).
3. **Evaluation Timeline:** Fixed start and end dates.
4. **Resource Commitments:** Named individuals from both sides who will participate.
5. **Post-Evaluation Commitment:** "Upon successful completion of all success criteria, [Prospect Company] commits to entering commercial negotiations within [5] business days."
6. **Signatures:** Both the SE (or SE Manager) and the prospect's technical sponsor must sign.

## Getting the Signature

Prospects will resist signing. They will say: "We don't need all this formality. Let's just get started."

Your response:

> *"This document protects both of us. It ensures that your team's evaluation objectives are crystal clear, and it ensures that our Solutions Architecture team is focused on exactly the right outcomes. Without this alignment, we risk spending 3 weeks testing the wrong things."*

Frame the signature as protection for *them*, not a sales tactic for you.

> **War Story:** An SE completed a flawless 30-day POC for a $350k deal. Every success criterion was met. The prospect's technical team was enthusiastic. But when the AE asked for next steps, the VP of IT said: "We never formally agreed that passing the POC meant we had to buy. We're going to evaluate two more vendors." Without a signed criteria document, the SE had no leverage. The deal entered a 6-month competitive bake-off that the SE eventually lost.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Handshake Deal." The SE starts the POC based on a verbal agreement with the technical champion. The champion leaves the company mid-evaluation. The new technical lead has no context on the agreed criteria and redefines the entire evaluation from scratch. The SE restarts a POC they had already completed.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you ensure that a successful POC translates into commercial momentum?"
A strong answer is: "Before every POC, I require a signed criteria document that defines 3-5 measurable success criteria, a fixed timeline, and a post-evaluation commitment to enter commercial negotiations within 5 business days of a successful outcome. This prevents moving goalposts and creates a contractual foundation for the AE to drive the close."

🔴 **Senior-Level** — An unsigned POC criteria document is a gentleman's agreement. Gentlemen's agreements don't close enterprise deals.
