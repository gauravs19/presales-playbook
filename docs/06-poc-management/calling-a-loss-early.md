# Calling a Loss Early and Extracting Value

The hardest skill in presales is walking away from a deal you've invested 100 hours in. But the math is brutally simple: every hour you spend on a dying POC is an hour you cannot spend on a winnable deal.

Calling a loss early is not giving up—it is reallocating resources to maximize revenue.

## The "Dead Deal" Warning Signs

### Signal 1: The Champion Disappears
Your primary contact stops responding to emails and misses standups. They have either lost internal political capital, been reassigned, or have privately decided to go with a competitor.

### Signal 2: New Requirements Appear After Day 10
The prospect introduces entirely new success criteria in the final days of the POC. This is not enthusiasm—it is sabotage. They are looking for a reason to extend the evaluation indefinitely or justify choosing the competitor.

### Signal 3: Procurement Goes Dark
The AE cannot get a meeting with procurement, finance, or the executive sponsor. The technical champion says "everything is on track" but cannot provide evidence of internal momentum.

### Signal 4: The Prospect Starts Benchmarking Against Free Alternatives
When the prospect starts asking: "Can you show how your platform compares to [open-source tool]?" or "What does your platform do that we couldn't build ourselves in 6 months?"—they are building a case to not buy anything.

### Signal 5: Excessive Politeness
This is the most dangerous signal because it feels positive. The prospect says everything is "great" and "really impressive" but never commits to specific next steps. Genuine buyers ask hard questions and push back. Polite prospects are usually letting you down gently.

## How to Call the Loss

### Step 1: The Internal Assessment
Discuss with the AE privately: "Based on these signals, I believe this deal is at high risk. Do you have any information that contradicts this assessment?" If the AE cannot provide concrete counter-evidence (e.g., a confirmed budget, a scheduled executive meeting), the deal is dead.

### Step 2: The Direct Conversation
Call the prospect's champion and have an honest conversation:

> *"I want to be direct with you. We've invested significant time in this evaluation and I'm sensing a shift in momentum. I'd rather have an honest conversation now than continue investing resources if priorities have changed on your side. Where does this stand internally?"*

This direct approach will yield one of three outcomes:
1. **They tell you the truth:** "Honestly, we're leaning toward Competitor X because of [reason]." Now you can either address the objection or walk away with intelligence.
2. **They recommit:** "No, we're still interested—we've just been swamped. Let me re-engage the team." (Validate this by asking for a specific next step with a date.)
3. **They confirm the loss:** "You're right. We've decided to go in a different direction." Now you can extract value.

## Extracting Value from a Loss

### 1. Request a Loss Debrief
Ask the prospect for 15 minutes of honest feedback: *"What was the primary factor in your decision? What would have changed the outcome?"* This intelligence is priceless for improving future evaluations.

### 2. Secure the Reference Anyway
Even if they didn't buy, ask: *"Would you be willing to serve as a technical reference for the quality of our POC process if we need one in the future?"* Many prospects will say yes because they respect the work you did.

### 3. Plant the Re-Engagement Seed
> *"I respect the decision. If the selected vendor doesn't deliver on what they promised during their evaluation, we'd welcome the opportunity to re-engage. I'll check in with you in 6 months."*

Set a CRM reminder for 6 months. Competitors fail post-sale more often than you think.

> **War Story:** An SE called a loss on Day 12 of a 14-day POC after the champion missed 3 consecutive standups. When the SE called the champion directly, the champion admitted they had already verbally committed to a competitor but were "too polite to tell you." The SE thanked them for their honesty, requested a loss debrief, and learned that the competitor won purely on price. 8 months later, the competitor failed to deliver on their SLA commitments. The prospect called the SE directly, and the SE won the deal on the re-engagement—at full price.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Zombie Pipeline Hoarder." This SE refuses to call a loss because it means admitting failure. They keep dead deals in the pipeline for months, reporting them as "active" to avoid the conversation with their manager. The pipeline looks healthy but the close rate is 5%. The SE Manager cannot accurately forecast revenue because 60% of the "active" pipeline is actually dead.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a deal you lost. What did you learn?"
A strong answer is: "I called a loss early on Day 12 of a POC after recognizing that the champion had gone dark and new requirements were being introduced to extend the evaluation. I had a direct conversation with the champion, who confirmed they were leaning toward a competitor on price. I requested a loss debrief, documented the learnings, and set a 6-month re-engagement reminder. When the competitor underdelivered, the prospect called us back and we won the deal at full price."

🔴 **Senior-Level** — The best SEs win more deals by refusing to waste time on the wrong ones. Call the loss, extract the lesson, move on.
