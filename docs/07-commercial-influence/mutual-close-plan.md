# The Mutual Close Plan

<!-- {"level": "Senior"} -->

The Mutual Close Plan (MCP) is the single most powerful deal control mechanism in enterprise sales. It is a jointly agreed, time-bound project plan that maps every milestone—from Technical Win to signed contract—with specific owners and deadlines on *both* sides.

When an AE asks, "How do we close this deal faster?", the answer is almost always: "Build a Mutual Close Plan with the prospect and hold them accountable to it."

## 1. Why Deals Drag Without an MCP

Enterprise deals die slowly. They don't explode in a dramatic loss—they bleed out over 6 months of "we're still evaluating" and "let's circle back next quarter."

The root cause is almost always a lack of mutual accountability. Without a shared plan:
*   The prospect's champion tells you, "We're moving forward!" but has not actually secured internal budget approval.
*   Legal sits on the contract for 3 weeks because it's in a queue behind 15 other vendor reviews.
*   The InfoSec team hasn't started their review because nobody told them a new vendor was being evaluated.

An MCP eliminates all of this by forcing the prospect to commit their internal resources to specific deadlines.

## 2. Building the MCP

The MCP should be a simple, one-page table (Google Sheet, Smartsheet, or even a shared Notion doc). It must be co-authored with the prospect's champion, not unilaterally created by the AE.

### The Template

| # | Milestone | Owner (Vendor) | Owner (Prospect) | Target Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Technical Discovery Complete | SE | CTO / IT Director | Week 1 | ✅ Done |
| 2 | POC Environment Provisioned | SE | IT Admin | Week 2 | ✅ Done |
| 3 | POC Execution & Success Criteria Validation | SE | Technical Evaluator | Week 3-4 | ✅ Done |
| 4 | **Technical Win Declared** | SE | Technical Evaluator | Week 5 | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Commercial Proposal Delivered | AE | Procurement | Week 5 | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Security Questionnaire Submitted | SE | InfoSec Team | Week 5 | 🔄 In Progress |
| 7 | Security Review Complete | — | InfoSec Team | Week 7 | ⬜ Pending |
| 8 | Legal Redline Initiated | AE / Legal | Prospect Legal | Week 7 | ⬜ Pending |
| 9 | Legal Redline Complete | AE / Legal | Prospect Legal | Week 9 | ⬜ Pending |
| 10 | Executive Approval / Budget Sign-Off | AE | VP / CFO | Week 9 | ⬜ Pending |
| 11 | **Purchase Order Issued** | — | Procurement / Finance | Week 10 | ⬜ Pending |
| 12 | Kickoff Call & Implementation Start | CS / SE | Project Sponsor | Week 11 | ⬜ Pending |

### Key Design Principles

1.  **Every milestone has a Prospect Owner.** If the prospect cannot assign an internal owner, that milestone will never happen. This is the strongest signal that the deal is not real.
2.  **Dates are specific.** Not "Q2" or "soon." Actual calendar dates. If the prospect refuses to commit to dates, the deal is stalled.
3.  **The plan starts from the desired Go-Live date and works backward.** Ask the prospect: "When do you need this system live?" Then map every preceding milestone backward from that date.

## 3. Using the MCP as a Deal Control Weapon

### The "Slippage" Conversation
When a milestone slips (and one always will), the MCP gives you the ammunition to have a direct accountability conversation.

<div class="roleplay-script">
  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-avatar">AE</div>
    <div class="speaker-message">
      <strong>Account Executive</strong>
      "Sarah, I wanted to flag that the Security Review was due last Friday per our joint plan, but InfoSec hasn't started their review yet. Based on our agreed timeline, this puts the PO issuance at risk of slipping past your fiscal year-end. Can you escalate internally to get InfoSec prioritized this week?"
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Without the MCP, this conversation is impossible. You would just be sending passive follow-up emails: "Hi, just checking in on the security review..."

With the MCP, you are holding the prospect accountable to *their own commitments*. You are no longer chasing them—you are managing a joint project.

### The "Compelling Event" Anchor
The most powerful MCPs are anchored to a prospect-side Compelling Event:
*   *"Our current vendor contract expires on June 30th."*
*   *"We have a board mandate to be live on a new platform by Q3."*
*   *"New SEC regulations go into effect September 1st."*

When you anchor the MCP to a Compelling Event, every slippage conversation becomes: *"If we don't complete Legal Redline by March 15th, we physically cannot meet your June 30th deadline. What do we need to do to unblock this?"*

## 4. When the Prospect Refuses the MCP

If the prospect's champion refuses to co-build a Mutual Close Plan, it is a massive red flag. It typically means one of three things:

1.  **They don't have internal buy-in.** They personally like your platform but have not secured budget, executive sponsorship, or InfoSec pre-approval. The deal is not real yet.
2.  **They are using you for leverage.** They have already selected a competitor and are using your proposal to negotiate a better price with their preferred vendor.
3.  **There is no timeline.** They are "exploring the market" with no urgency to purchase. This is a tire-kicker.

In all three cases, the SE and AE should seriously consider de-prioritizing the deal and reallocating their time to opportunities where the prospect is willing to commit to a mutual plan.

> **War Story:** An AE had been chasing a $400k deal for 5 months with no clear timeline. The SE suggested building a Mutual Close Plan and presenting it to the prospect's VP of Engineering. During the MCP review, the VP revealed that their current vendor's contract expired in 45 days—a compelling event nobody on the sales team had uncovered. The MCP was immediately re-built backward from that date, compressing the remaining milestones into 6 weeks. The deal closed 2 days before the existing contract expired. Without the MCP forcing the conversation, the compelling event would have gone undiscovered and the deal would have slipped another quarter.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Passive Follow-Up." The AE sends weekly "just checking in" emails to the prospect instead of building a joint action plan. The prospect politely replies "still working on it internally" for 4 months. There is no shared accountability, no milestone tracking, and no urgency. The deal dies quietly in the pipeline, and the AE marks it as "Closed Lost — No Decision" at the end of the quarter.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you maintain deal momentum after the technical win is secured?"
A strong answer is: "I co-build a Mutual Close Plan with the prospect's champion immediately after the Technical Win. The plan maps every remaining milestone—security review, legal redline, executive approval, PO issuance—with specific owners and dates on both sides. When a milestone slips, I use the plan as the basis for an accountability conversation. This converts passive follow-up into active project management and typically compresses the post-Technical Win cycle by 30-40%."

🔴 **Senior-Level** — The deal is not won at the Technical Win. It is won when the PO is issued. The MCP is how you get there.
