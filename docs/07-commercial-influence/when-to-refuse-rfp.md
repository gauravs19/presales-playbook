# Deciding When to Refuse an RFP

<!-- {"level": "Senior"} -->

For many sales reps, an inbound Request for Proposal (RFP) feels like a gift. For a seasoned Solutions Engineer, an inbound RFP is a mathematical trap designed to waste 40 hours of your week on a deal you have a 0% chance of winning.

Except in highly regulated public sectors or government sales (where RFPs are mandatory for all purchases), a corporate RFP is usually a sign that **you are already losing to another vendor**.

Knowing when to refuse an RFP—or how to blow it up entirely—is a critical commercial skill.

## 1. The Psychology of the RFP

Why do companies issue 200-question spreadsheets?

1.  **They already selected a vendor (The "Column Fodder" Trap):** They know they want Competitor X. But procurement policy dictates they must evaluate 3 vendors and get 3 bids to ensure market pricing. They found you via Google so you can be Vendor B.
2.  **They don't know what they are buying (The "Fishing Expedition"):** The prospect has a vague business problem. Instead of doing discovery or paying a consulting firm, they download an RFP template from the internet, blast it to 10 vendors, and hope the answers clarify their strategy.
3.  **Strict Compliance/Procurement Mandate:** Usually seen in Healthcare, Finance, and Government.

If you are dealing with Scenario 1 or Scenario 2, responding to the RFP is a catastrophic waste of SE capacity.

## 2. The SE's Checklist for Refusing an RFP

Before you agree to answer a single technical question on a new RFP, demand that the Account Executive answer the following three questions. If the AE cannot answer them, you do not write the RFP.

### Check 1: Did we write the RFP?
Read the technical requirements section. Are the questions generic, or are they suspiciously specific?
*   *Red Flag:* "Does the system support a distributed graph-database architecture for mapping hierarchical node structures?"
*   *Reality Check:* The prospect didn't come up with that requirement. A competitor SE wrote that question because they know their graph-database is their only differentiator against your relational database. If the RFP reads like a competitor's marketing brochure, **you are column fodder.**

### Check 2: Do we have access to the business owner?
If a procurement officer sends an RFP and says, *"All questions must be submitted via the portal. No direct contact with the business team is allowed,"* the deal is functionally dead. 
*   You cannot do discovery. You cannot reframe the problem. You cannot pitch ROI. You can only compete on price against a spreadsheet. Refuse it.

### Check 3: Is there a funded mandate?
Why are they buying this *now*? If the RFP does not have a clear "Compelling Event" (e.g., "Our current contract expires in 90 days" or "New SEC regulations go into effect in Q3"), it is a fishing expedition.

## 3. How to "Blow Up" an RFP Instead of Refusing It

Sometimes, you cannot politically refuse an RFP. Instead, you deploy an "RFP Blow Up" strategy. The goal is to refuse the *format* of the RFP, and force the prospect into a real sales cycle.

**The "Blow Up" Script for AEs/SEs:**

> *"Mr. Prospect, we received your RFP. We would love to participate. However, our engineering teams have found that 200-line spreadsheets rarely result in a successful implementation because they lack business context.*
>
> *Before we commit 40 hours of our Solutions Architecture team to answering this, we require a 45-minute scoping call with [Executive Sponsor]. If we cannot align the technical requirements to the actual business outcome during that call, we will politely decline to bid."*

**The Outcomes of the "Blow Up":**

1.  **They say NO:** "Sorry, procurement rules say no calls." → **Result:** You walk away. You just saved 40 hours of your life.
2.  **They say YES:** → **Result:** You just successfully bypassed the procurement wall, secured a meeting with the real decision-maker, and converted a blind RFP into an actual discovery cycle. You are now in control of the deal.
