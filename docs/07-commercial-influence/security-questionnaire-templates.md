# Pre-Populating Security Questionnaires

<!-- {"level": "Mid-Level"} -->

The security questionnaire is the most time-consuming, soul-crushing artifact in enterprise presales. A single questionnaire can contain 300-700 questions about encryption, access controls, incident response, data residency, and compliance certifications.

If you answer each questionnaire from scratch, you will burn 20-40 hours per deal on security paperwork alone. This is unsustainable and unscalable.

The solution is a **Pre-Populated Master Questionnaire Library** that allows you to respond to 80% of any inbound questionnaire within hours, not weeks.

## 1. Building the Master Questionnaire Library

### Step 1: Collect the Frameworks
Gather every security questionnaire your company has completed in the last 12 months. You will notice that despite different formats, 80% of the questions map to the same underlying security controls.

The most common frameworks are:
*   **SIG (Standardized Information Gathering)** — Financial Services standard
*   **CAIQ (Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire)** — Cloud/SaaS standard
*   **NIST 800-53** — US Government standard
*   **CIS Controls** — General IT security baseline
*   **Custom** — Company-specific questionnaires (often a combination of the above)

### Step 2: Normalize the Questions
Create a master spreadsheet (Google Sheets works perfectly) with the following structure:

| Control ID | Category | Canonical Question | Approved Answer | Last Reviewed | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-001 | Encryption | How is data encrypted at rest? | AES-256 via AWS KMS with customer-managed keys (CMK). All data volumes are encrypted by default with no option to disable. | 2025-12-01 | InfoSec Team |
| SEC-002 | Encryption | How is data encrypted in transit? | TLS 1.3 enforced for all external connections. TLS 1.2 minimum. Internal service-to-service communication uses mTLS. | 2025-12-01 | InfoSec Team |
| SEC-003 | Authentication | What authentication protocols are supported? | SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC). MFA enforced for all admin accounts. SCIM 2.0 for automated user provisioning. | 2025-12-01 | Product Team |
| SEC-004 | Access Control | How is role-based access control (RBAC) implemented? | Granular RBAC with predefined roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) and custom role creation. Permissions are enforced at the API layer. All access changes are audit-logged. | 2025-12-01 | Product Team |

### Step 3: Assign Ownership
Each answer must have an internal owner (InfoSec, Engineering, Legal, Product). When the underlying facts change (e.g., you upgrade from TLS 1.2 to TLS 1.3), the owner is responsible for updating the master library.

## 2. The "Rapid Response" Workflow

When a new security questionnaire arrives from a prospect:

1.  **Triage (15 minutes):** Scan the questionnaire and identify which framework it is based on (SIG, CAIQ, Custom).
2.  **Auto-Map (1-2 hours):** Map each prospect question to the closest Control ID in your master library. Copy the approved answer.
3.  **Customize (1-2 hours):** Review the 20% of questions that don't have a direct match. These are usually prospect-specific questions about their industry (e.g., HIPAA for Healthcare, PCI-DSS for Payments). Write custom answers for these.
4.  **Review (30 minutes):** Have your InfoSec or Legal team review the completed questionnaire before submission.

**Total time: 4-6 hours** instead of 40 hours.

## 3. Proactive Submission

Do not wait for the prospect to send you their questionnaire. The moment a deal enters the POC stage, proactively send your pre-populated security fact sheet to the prospect's technical champion with the following note:

> *"To accelerate your internal review process, I've attached our standard Security Posture document covering encryption, authentication, compliance certifications, and data residency. This should pre-answer the majority of your InfoSec team's questions. If your security team has a specific questionnaire format they prefer, please send it over and we'll complete it within 48 hours."*

This achieves three things:
1.  **Speed:** The InfoSec review starts weeks earlier, running in parallel with the POC.
2.  **Control:** By submitting your document first, you frame the security conversation on your terms.
3.  **Credibility:** The prospect immediately perceives you as a mature, enterprise-grade vendor.

## 4. Maintaining the Library

The master library is a living document. Schedule a quarterly review cycle:

*   [ ] Are all compliance certifications current (SOC 2 audit dates, ISO 27001 renewal)?
*   [ ] Have any infrastructure changes invalidated existing answers (e.g., cloud provider migration)?
*   [ ] Are there new regulatory requirements that need new entries (e.g., EU AI Act, India DPDP)?
*   [ ] Have any recent prospect questionnaires introduced new question categories that should be added to the library?
