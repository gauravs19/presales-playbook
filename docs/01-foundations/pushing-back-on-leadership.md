#### 1.3.4 When to Push Back on Leadership

"Focus on the deals the AE tells you to focus on" is fine advice for a Junior SE. For a Senior SE, it's career-limiting. At the Senior level, you're expected to have a point of view on team strategy, resource allocation, and deal prioritisation — and to communicate that view to leadership even when it's uncomfortable.

The difference between "pushing back" and "being difficult" is data, timing, and delivery.

1. **Push back when leadership is over-committing the SE team.** If your SE manager accepts every AE request without filtering, the team gets spread too thin. When you see this happening, quantify the impact: "We have 6 SEs covering 48 deals. That's 8 deals per SE. Based on our average deal complexity, each SE can effectively manage 5–6 deals with adequate quality. We're either going to drop quality across the board or we need to tier our portfolio and invest minimally in the bottom 30%." Numbers beat opinions. Every time.

2. **Push back when a deal strategy doesn't match the evidence.** Your VP of Sales believes a deal is Q3. Your discovery shows the prospect hasn't completed their budget cycle, which means they can't approve spend until Q4 at the earliest. Don't argue about optimism. Present the evidence: "Based on my discovery notes, the prospect's budget approval process requires VP and CFO sign-off, which only happens during their September planning cycle. The earliest commercial approval is late Q4." You're not calling the VP wrong. You're adding data they didn't have.

3. **Push back when product limitations are being hidden.** If leadership instructs you to avoid discussing a known product limitation during evaluations, you have an ethical and professional obligation to push back. Hiding limitations doesn't prevent discoveries — it delays them until the worst possible moment: during a live POC, during procurement's security questionnaire, or after the contract is signed when post-sales discovers the gap. "I'd recommend we acknowledge the limitation proactively and frame our roadmap around it. Prospects respect transparency. They punish late surprises."

4. **Pick your battles with extreme care.** Not everything is worth pushing back on. If your manager wants to restructure the weekly team meeting format and you disagree — let it go. If your VP wants to change the CRM fields SEs are required to fill — let it go. Save your pushback capital for decisions that affect deal outcomes, team capacity, or professional integrity. The SE who pushes back on everything has no more influence than the SE who pushes back on nothing.

5. **Deliver pushback with proposals, not just objections.** "I disagree with this approach" is complaint. "I disagree with this approach — here's an alternative that achieves the same goal with less risk" is leadership. Every pushback should include a counter-proposal. If you can't articulate a better alternative, your pushback might just be resistance to change rather than strategic disagreement.

> **War Story:** An SE team was told by the VP of Sales to run a full POC for a "strategic account." The lead SE reviewed the opportunity and found zero: no identified champion, no confirmed budget, no decision criteria. Just a CRO-to-CRO handshake at a conference. The lead SE wrote a one-page memo to the VP: "I support investing in this account. However, a POC at this stage will consume 4 weeks of SE bandwidth with no technical win criteria graded against it. I recommend a 2-hour Executive Discovery session first to validate that the business pain justifies a full evaluation. If discovery confirms fit, we proceed to POC with defined success criteria." The VP agreed. The discovery session revealed that the prospect had no current pain — they were exploring for a project budgeted 18 months out. The VP's instinct was right (strategic account). The SE's instinct was also right (wrong time for a POC). The memo saved 160 hours of SE effort.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who pushes back on leadership through passive resistance. Instead of raising concerns directly, they delay, deprioritise, or underperform on tasks they disagree with. The demo they didn't want to do is underprepared. The POC they think is a waste runs at 50% effort. The AE notices. The manager notices. The SE is labelled "difficult" — not because they pushed back, but because they did it covertly. Active pushback is respected. Passive resistance is career-ending.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a time you disagreed with a decision made by your leadership. How did you handle it?"
A strong answer describes a specific disagreement, the data used to support the pushback, the proposed alternative, and the outcome. A weak answer describes either silent compliance or unproductive confrontation.

**Practical Reference: The Pushback Decision Framework**

Before pushing back, run through this checklist:

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Does this decision materially affect deal outcomes? | Push back — with data | Let it go |
| Do I have evidence to support my alternative? | Present it clearly | Wait until you do |
| Is this a hill worth dying on? | Escalate if needed | Choose a different battle |
| Have I proposed a better alternative? | Deliver both the objection and the solution | Go back and build one |
| Am I pushing back because I'm right, or because I'm uncomfortable? | Proceed | Reflect before acting |

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Pushing back is a senior SE skill. It's not about being contrarian. It's about being responsible enough to surface risks that nobody else is willing to name.
