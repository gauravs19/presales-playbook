#### 1.5.4 The Follow-Up That Feels Human

The post-meeting follow-up is the most underinvested interaction in presales. Most SEs treat it as an administrative task: paste bullet points into an email, attach a slide deck, send. Done. Next meeting. But the follow-up is where deals are actually advanced — because it's where you demonstrate listening, precision, and care in a format the prospect can share internally.

A follow-up that feels human makes the prospect feel heard. A follow-up that feels automated makes the prospect feel like a pipeline entry.

1. **Open with what you heard, not what you showed.** The first paragraph of every follow-up should summarise the prospect's stated pain — in their words, not yours. "Based on our conversation, your team is spending approximately 15 hours per week on manual data reconciliation between SAP and Snowflake, which is delaying your month-end close by 3–4 days." This accomplishes three things: it proves you listened, it documents the pain in writing (which the champion can forward internally), and it anchors the follow-up to the prospect's world rather than your product's world.

2. **Answer the questions you took offline.** If you said "I'll get back to you on that" during the meeting, this is where you deliver. Quickly. Precisely. With documentation. "You asked about our data residency options for EU customers. Our platform supports region-locked data processing in Frankfurt, Dublin, and London. Here's the documentation: [link]." Every offline question you answer in the follow-up builds trust. Every question you forget to answer erodes it.

3. **Name the next step explicitly — with a date.** "As discussed, we'd like to schedule a technical deep-dive with your infrastructure team to map integration requirements. Would Thursday, March 13th at 2 PM work for your group?" A vague "let's find time to continue the conversation" guarantees a 2-week scheduling delay. A specific date and time guarantees a yes/no response within 24 hours. The prospect's time is limited. Respect it by not making them do the scheduling work.

4. **Keep it under 300 words.** Your follow-up is competing with 47 other emails in the prospect's inbox. If it reads like a white paper, it won't be read. Bullet points. Short paragraphs. Bold the key points. The detail belongs in attachments, not in the email body. The email body is the executive summary that earns the click on the attachment.

5. **Personalise one element.** Include one line that references something specific, non-transactional from the meeting: "Enjoyed your comment about your team's experience migrating off the legacy Oracle system — that context is incredibly useful for shaping our approach." This single line transforms a vendor email into a human interaction. The prospect reads it and thinks, "They actually paid attention," instead of "They sent me a template."

> **War Story:** Two SEs were competing for the same deal. Both had successful demos. Both were technically strong. SE #1 sent a follow-up the next day: a 200-word email summarising the key pain points the prospect raised, three answers to questions taken offline (with links to docs), a proposed date for the next session, and one personal note about the prospect's question regarding their data centre migration timeline. SE #2 sent a follow-up 4 days later: a 600-word email recapping everything the product could do, with a 15-page slide deck attached. The champion forwarded SE #1's email to the CTO the same day with the note: "These are the people who understood what we need." The champion never forwarded SE #2's email. The deal closed with SE #1's company.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who sends "great meeting today, attaching the deck and a recording of the demo. Let me know if you have questions." This is not a follow-up. It's a file transfer. It communicates zero listening, zero personalisation, and zero initiative. The prospect's response will be no response — because the email doesn't ask for anything, contribute anything, or advance anything.

**Interview Angle:**
"What does your typical post-meeting follow-up process look like?"
A strong answer describes a structured, personalised follow-up that includes pain recapitulation, offline answers, and specific next steps. A weak answer describes "sending the deck and notes."

Subject: Follow-up: [Meeting Topic] — [Specific Next Step]

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your time today. Here's a summary of what we discussed:

**Your Current Challenge:**
[2-3 sentences paraphrasing their stated pain in their language]

**Questions We Addressed Offline:**
- [Question 1]: [Answer + link to documentation]
- [Question 2]: [Answer + link to documentation]

**Next Step:**
[Specific proposed action] — would [specific date and time] work for your team?

[One personal/contextual note from the meeting]

Best,
[Your name]
```

Total writing time: 15 minutes. Impact: disproportionate.

🟡 **Mid-Level** — The follow-up is not the epilogue. It's the first page of the next chapter. Treat it with the same intentionality as the meeting itself.
