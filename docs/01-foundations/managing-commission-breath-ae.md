#### 1.2.2 Managing the Commission-Breath AE

"Commission-Breath" is the industry term for an AE who is so desperate to close a deal that their desperation becomes visible — to you, to the prospect, and eventually to the competitor who capitalises on it. Commission-breath AEs don't make bad decisions because they're bad salespeople. They make bad decisions because their quota pressure has overwhelmed their judgement. Your job isn't to judge them. It's to protect the deal from their anxiety.

1. **Recognise the signs early.** Commission-breath manifests as: pushing for demos before discovery is complete ("just show them something, we're running out of time"), insisting on discounting before the prospect has even asked ("let's lead with 30% off to make sure we win"), fabricating urgency ("the prospect says they're deciding Friday" — when no such statement was made), and scheduling too many meetings ("let's do daily check-ins with the champion"). These are stress behaviours, not strategy.

2. **Anchor them with a deal plan.** The best antidote to commission-breath is a written deal plan that sequences the next 6–8 steps with specific dates and owners. When the AE says "let's just demo tomorrow," you can point to the plan: "Our agreed next step is to complete the technical discovery with their infrastructure team on Thursday. Demoing before that will expose us to requirements we haven't surfaced yet." Plans give both of you an objective reference point that's harder to override with emotion.

3. **Protect the prospect from the pressure.** If the AE's desperation is becoming visible to the prospect — overeager follow-ups, gratuitous discounting, manufactured deadlines — you need to intervene as the "calm professional" on your team. In customer meetings, take the temperature down. "We want to make sure this evaluation is thorough and meets your team's standards. Let's walk through the architecture questions your team raised." You're signalling to the prospect that at least one person on your side is focused on their needs rather than your internal deadline.

4. **Have the conversation privately, once.** If the behaviour is persistent, address it directly — once, clearly, and without accusation: "I'm concerned that if we push for a decision before they've finished their security review, we'll lose credibility. Can we align on a timeline that matches their process?" If the AE adjusts, great. If they don't, escalate to your SE manager. Do not continue to fight this battle on every deal — escalation exists for a reason.

5. **Understand when the pressure comes from above.** Sometimes the AE isn't the source. Their sales manager is pressuring them to commit deals they know aren't ready. The AE is caught between a demand they can't refuse and a reality they can't change. In these cases, empathy matters. Aligned pushback from both AE and SE to the sales leadership — "we both believe this deal is Q2, not Q1, and here's the evidence" — is far more effective than the SE fighting the AE.

> **War Story:** An AE was 60% to quota with 3 weeks left in the quarter. He had one deal that could get him to 90%. The SE saw the prospect's procurement team hadn't even begun their security review — a process that typically took 4–6 weeks at that company. The AE insisted on "getting the deal to paper" by submitting a deeply discounted proposal. The SE pushed back privately: "If we discount now before security clears us, we set a price anchor we can't recover from, and we still won't close this quarter because procurement hasn't started." The AE didn't listen. He submitted the proposal at 40% off list. Procurement took 7 weeks. The deal closed the following quarter — at the discounted price. The company left $180K on the table because the AE's anxiety set the price 8 weeks too early.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who enables commission-breath because they want to be seen as "a team player." They agree to demo before discovery. They help fabricate urgency by sending "limited-time pricing" emails they know aren't real. They co-author proposals that overclaim capabilities to create a sense of momentum. In the short term, the AE loves them. In the long term, they're complicit in a pattern that loses deals, damages customer relationships, and builds a reputation for dishonesty.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a time an AE wanted to move faster than you thought was appropriate. How did you handle it?"
A strong answer shows the SE anchoring to process (deal plan, qualification data), communicating directly with the AE, and protecting the deal outcome even at the cost of short-term friction. A weak answer prioritises "keeping the peace" over deal quality.

**Practical Reference: The Commission-Breath De-Escalation Script**
When the AE proposes a premature action, use this framework:

*"I hear you — I know the timeline pressure is real. Here's my concern: if we [proposed premature action], we risk [specific negative outcome]. What I'd recommend instead is [alternative action] by [specific date]. That gets us to the same place, but with the prospect's trust intact. Does that work?"*

This script validates the AE's pressure, names the risk, proposes an alternative, and sets a date. It's collaborative, not confrontational.

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Managing commission-breath is a diplomacy exercise. You're protecting the deal, the prospect, and the AE — often from themselves. Get comfortable with productive discomfort.
