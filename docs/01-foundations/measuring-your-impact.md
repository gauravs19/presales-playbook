#### 1.1.4 Measuring Your Personal Impact From Day One

Most SEs cannot answer this question: "How much revenue did you personally influence last quarter?" They'll give you a team number, or their AE's pipeline, or a vague "I was involved in several deals." That's not your impact — that's proximity to impact. If you can't quantify your contribution, you can't negotiate compensation, you can't build a promotion case, and you can't defend your headcount when budget cuts come.

Here's how to measure yourself, starting today:

1. **Track SE-influenced revenue, not AE pipeline.** Your influence is the revenue that closed on deals where you were the primary or contributing SE. If an AE closes a $300K deal and you ran the discovery, demo, and POC, that's $300K of SE-influenced revenue. If you joined one meeting late in the cycle to answer a technical question, that's not your deal — don't claim it. Honest attribution builds credible metrics. Inflated attribution builds a number that nobody trusts when you present it in a promotion review.

2. **Calculate your technical win rate.** Of all the deals where you declared (or could have declared) a technical win, how many actually went on to close commercially? A 30% technical win rate means either you're declaring wins too early, or the post-technical-win commercial process is failing. A 70%+ rate means you're qualifying well and only investing in winnable deals. This number is the single best indicator of SE effectiveness — better than demos delivered, calls made, or hours worked.

3. **Measure your discovery-to-demo conversion.** How many discovery calls result in a scheduled demo? If you're running discoveries that don't convert, either your discovery is too shallow (you're not uncovering enough pain to justify a next step) or you're running discoveries on deals that shouldn't have progressed that far (qualification failure). A healthy conversion is 70–85%.

4. **Track deal velocity on your deals vs. team average.** How long do your deals take from first SE engagement to technical win compared to the team average? If you're consistently faster, it means your discovery and solution design are efficient. If you're consistently slower, find out why — are you over-engineering solutions, running POCs that should have been skipped, or failing to create urgency in the evaluation process?

5. **Log your "deals saved" — qualitatively.** Not everything fits in a spreadsheet. Keep a running log of moments where your intervention materially changed a deal outcome. "The prospect was about to go dark after a bad demo. I proposed a rescue call focused on their top 3 pain points. The call happened. The deal re-engaged and closed 6 weeks later." These qualitative entries become the stories you tell in promotion discussions and interviews. Numbers prove impact. Stories make impact memorable.

> **War Story:** An SE went into her annual review with a single document: a spreadsheet showing 22 deals she'd been involved in, her specific contribution to each (discovery, demo, POC, rescue call), the revenue outcome, and her calculated technical win rate of 44%. Her manager was surprised — not by the number, but by the fact that she'd tracked it at all. Nobody else on the team could produce this data. She was the only SE who could objectively demonstrate her contribution. She got the largest merit increase on the team. The next year, she tracked the same metrics, improved to 52%, and was promoted. The spreadsheet didn't get her promoted. The self-awareness it represented — and the improvement it enabled — did.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who measures activity, not outcomes. They track: demos delivered (47 this quarter!), calls attended (92!), POCs completed (6!). These are effort metrics. They tell you what you did, not what you accomplished. An SE who delivered 47 demos with a 15% win rate generated less revenue than an SE who delivered 12 demos with a 55% win rate. The second SE worked less and produced more. Activity metrics are vanity metrics. Outcome metrics are career metrics.

**Interview Angle:**
"What metrics do you use to measure your effectiveness as an SE?"
A strong answer includes SE-influenced revenue, technical win rate, and at least one velocity or conversion metric. A weak answer describes activity metrics ("demos per week") or defers entirely ("my manager tracks that").

**Practical Reference: The SE Impact Dashboard**
Build this in a simple spreadsheet. Update it monthly.

| Metric | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Target |
|--------|----|----|----|----|--------|
| SE-Influenced Revenue (Closed-Won) | | | | | Company variable |
| Technical Win Rate | | | | | > 40% |
| Discovery-to-Demo Conversion | | | | | > 75% |
| Average Days to Technical Win | | | | | < team average |
| Deals Actively Managed | | | | | 8–12 (quality over quantity) |
| "Deals Saved" (qualitative log) | | | | | 1–2 per quarter |

**The SE who tracks these numbers owns their career. The SE who doesn't becomes a passenger in it.**

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Impact measurement isn't something your manager does to evaluate you. It's something you do to steer yourself. Start tracking before anyone asks you to.
