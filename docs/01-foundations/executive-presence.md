#### 1.5.1 Executive Presence — Commanding a Room Without Shouting

Executive presence is not charisma, confidence, or authority. It's the perception that you belong in the room — any room — because you add value that no one else in that room provides. SEs who have executive presence get invited to CxO meetings. SEs who don't get asked to "send the technical details after the call."

The bad news: executive presence can't be faked. The good news: it can be built, deliberately and incrementally.

1. **Start with silence.** The most common executive presence mistake is talking too much in high-stakes settings. When a CTO asks a hard question, the SE without presence starts answering immediately, verbose and rambling, trying to fill every second with words. The SE with presence pauses for 2–3 seconds, then delivers a concise answer. The pause accomplishes three things: it signals that you're thinking (not reacting), it creates gravity (silence is power), and it gives you time to choose the right framing.

2. **Speak in headlines, then unpack.** Executives process information top-down. Lead with the conclusion: "Yes, our platform can support your compliance requirements across all three jurisdictions." Then unpack the detail only if they ask. If they nod and move on, you've answered the question in 8 seconds instead of 8 minutes. If they probe deeper, you can layer in the specifics. Headline-first communication signals that you respect their time and understand their altitude.

3. **Own the room with your body, not your voice.** In person: sit upright, make deliberate eye contact, and occupy your full space at the table. Don't slouch, don't fidget, don't cross your arms. On video: camera at eye level, good lighting on your face, and an uncluttered background. These are not vanity considerations — they are visual trust signals. An executive meeting a vendor for the first time reads your physical presentation before they hear a single word.

4. **Use names deliberately.** When addressing a CTO, CFO, or any executive, use their name: "Sarah, the concern you raised about data sovereignty is one we see frequently in regulated industries." Using names creates personal connection, signals preparation, and transforms a generic product discussion into a directed conversation. It also prevents the executive from disengaging — hearing your own name activates attention.

5. **Admit what you don't know without apologising.** An SE without executive presence says: "Sorry, I don't — I'm not sure about that one, let me check..." An SE with presence says: "I want to give you a precise answer on that. I'll confirm the specific number and have it to you by end of day." Same outcome. Completely different impression. The first version signals uncertainty. The second signals discipline. Executives don't expect omniscience. They expect intellectual honesty delivered with composure.

> **War Story:** A Senior SE was invited to present to a FTSE 100 company's C-suite — CFO, CTO, and COO in the room. Her AE warned her: "The CFO interrupts everyone. Don't let it rattle you." Seven minutes into her presentation, the CFO cut in: "Skip the technology. Tell me why I should spend £2M with you instead of building it ourselves." She paused for 3 seconds. Then: "Because it would take your team 18 months to build what we deploy in 6 weeks — and during those 18 months, you'd miss two regulatory filing windows at £300K in penalties each. Our platform eliminates that risk from day one." Silence. The CFO nodded. "Continue." She didn't have a pre-prepared answer. She had practised the pause, the headline format, and the financial framing until they were reflexive. The deal closed at £2.4M.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who tries to build executive presence by being domineering. They talk over people, project artificial confidence, and use jargon to signal superiority. Executives see through this instantly — they deal with posturing daily. What they're pattern-matching for is substance and composure, not dominance. The SE who tries to command a room by force ends up commanding a room full of people who've decided not to buy.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a time you presented to C-level executives. How did you prepare and how did it go?"
A strong answer describes specific preparation (researching the executive's priorities, practising concise delivery), a real moment of pressure (a hard question, an interruption), and how they handled it. A weak answer describes the content of the presentation without commenting on the interpersonal dynamics.

**Practical Reference: The Executive Presence Checklist**
Before any C-suite meeting:

- [ ] Researched each executive's background, recent priorities, and public statements
- [ ] Prepared 3 "headline" answers to likely questions (conclusion first, detail on request)
- [ ] Practised the 3-second pause after hard questions
- [ ] Tested camera/audio/lighting (virtual) or confirmed seating and materials (in-person)
- [ ] Identified the #1 business outcome that matters most to the economic buyer
- [ ] Removed all jargon from my opening 5 minutes

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Executive presence is a muscle. It atrophies without practice and strengthens with repetition. Seek opportunities to present to senior audiences — even internal ones — at least once a month.
