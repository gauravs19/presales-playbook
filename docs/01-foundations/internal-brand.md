#### 1.3.2 Building Your Internal Brand

Your internal brand is how your company's sales team, leadership, and product organisation think about you when your name comes up. It's not your resume. It's the reputation that determines which deals you're assigned, which leaders ask for your opinion, and whether anyone fights for your headcount when budget cuts come.

Most SEs never think about their internal brand. They assume that good work speaks for itself. It doesn't. Good work speaks to the people who witness it. Internal brand speaks to everyone else.

1. **Choose your positioning deliberately.** You cannot be known for everything. Pick 2–3 specialisations and make them your signature. "The SE who understands healthcare compliance." "The SE who rescues stalled enterprise deals." "The SE who can whiteboard an architecture in any customer meeting." These reputations are built by consistent, visible contributions in a single domain — not by being generically good across everything.

2. **Make your contributions visible without self-promotion.** The line between visibility and self-promotion is tone. Visibility: "Here's a discovery framework I built that shortened my last 3 deal cycles — sharing in case it's useful for the team." Self-promotion: "I just saved a $500K deal by redesigning the entire POC approach." Share methods, not medals. People remember who helps them, not who brags to them.

3. **Build alliances outside presales.** Your internal brand is strongest when people who aren't SEs vouch for you. The Product Manager who says, "They gave us the best field intelligence we got all year." The Professional Services lead who says, "Their solution designs are the easiest to implement because they actually consider post-sales reality." The Sales VP who says, "When they flag a deal risk, I listen." These cross-functional endorsements are more powerful than any self-assessment.

4. **Volunteer for the unglamorous work.** Everyone wants to be on the biggest deal. The SE who volunteers to fix the team's demo environment, build an objection-handling guide, or onboard a new hire earns a different kind of reputation — reliability. Reliability compounds. The SE who's reliably present for the team earns the trust to be reliably absent from bad deals.

5. **Control the narrative when things go wrong.** You will lose deals. You will make mistakes. Your internal brand is tested not when things go right, but when things go wrong. The SE who loses a deal and writes a transparent post-mortem ("Here's what I would do differently") protects their brand. The SE who loses a deal and blames the AE, the product, or the prospect damages their brand — even if the blame is justified. Ownership is currency. Blame is debt.

> **War Story:** An SE at a mid-size SaaS company was technically average — not the strongest architect, not the best presenter. But she built a reputation for one specific thing: she ran the most disciplined POCs on the team, and her POC-to-win conversion was 78% (team average was 45%). Over 18 months, every AE on the enterprise team wanted her on their deals. When a VP role opened for Solutions Engineering, the CRO didn't ask "who's the best technician?" — they asked "who do AEs trust the most?" Her name came up unanimously. She got the role. Her internal brand — "the SE who converts POCs" — was worth more than any certification or technical depth.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who has no internal brand because they never contribute beyond their assigned deals. They do good work, quietly, on the deals they're given. They don't share frameworks. They don't mentor. They don't attend team meetings with any opinions. When promotions open, leadership says, "They're solid but I don't really know what they bring beyond deal execution." Solid is not a brand. Solid is a synonym for "safe to keep, not important enough to promote."

**Interview Angle:**
"How would your AE partners and SE peers describe your strengths?"
A strong answer articulates a clear, specific brand position ("They'd say I'm the person who turns complex technical situations into clear executive communication"). A weak answer gives generic virtues ("They'd say I'm hardworking and reliable").

**Practical Reference: The Internal Brand Audit**

Ask yourself — and then verify with 2 trusted colleagues:

| Question | Your Answer | Their Answer |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| What am I known for on the team? | | |
| What deals do people associate me with? | | |
| What would an AE say about working with me? | | |
| When does leadership ask for my opinion? | | |
| What's the gap between how I see myself and how others see me? | | |

The gap in the last row is your brand development priority.

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Your internal brand is an asset or a liability. It's never neutral. Build it with the same intentionality you'd apply to building a customer relationship.
