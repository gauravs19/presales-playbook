#### 1.2.3 When to Overrule Your AE

This section will make some AEs uncomfortable. Good. Because the SE who never overrules their AE isn't a partner — they're an order-taker. And order-takers don't protect deals. Order-takers protect relationships with AEs at the expense of relationships with prospects.

There are specific, limited situations where the SE must overrule the AE's judgement. Doing it wisely is what separates a respected senior SE from a political casualty.

1. **Overrule when the AE is making a false technical claim.** If the AE tells a prospect "yes, we support real-time CDC from SAP HANA to Snowflake natively" and you know that's not true, you cannot let that stand. Not because you want to embarrass the AE. Because if the prospect builds their evaluation around a capability you don't have, you will lose the deal later — and lose it badly, with the prospect feeling lied to. The technique: don't contradict in the meeting. Instead, add precision: "To make sure we're accurate here — our platform handles the CDC pipeline, but the SAP connector requires a specific configuration for HANA. Let me send the exact specs after this call so your team can validate fit." You've corrected the record without calling the AE a liar.

2. **Overrule when the AE wants to skip discovery.** "They already know what they want — just demo it." This sentence has killed more deals than any competitor. If the AE pushes for a demo without discovery, and you proceed, you'll demo blind — showing features that may or may not map to the prospect's actual requirements. The result is a generic, forgettable presentation that gives the prospect no reason to choose you over anyone else. Hold the line: "I can demo Thursday, but I need 30 minutes with their technical lead first to make sure what I show is relevant. Otherwise we're guessing."

3. **Overrule when the AE is scoping a POC you can't win.** Sometimes an AE agrees to POC terms that are designed to favour a competitor: criteria that test capabilities where the competitor is strongest, timelines that are too aggressive for your team, or scope that includes roadmap features as if they're shipping. If you proceed, you're setting up a public failure. The overrule here is pre-emptive: "Before I commit to this POC, I need to review the success criteria with our team. I want to make sure we can deliver on every line item — if there's something we can't do today, I need to flag it now, not in week 3."

4. **Overrule when the AE is ignoring a deal-killing risk.** You've flagged a data sovereignty requirement. The AE waved it off: "They'll work around it." You've flagged that the prospect is also evaluating a competitor who has a significant advantage in one area. The AE dismissed it: "They're not a real threat." When the AE is ignoring a risk that you believe will kill the deal, document your concern in writing (CRM note, email, Slack) and escalate to your SE manager if the AE won't engage. The documentation protects you when the deal is lost and the post-mortem asks, "Did anyone see this coming?"

5. **Never overrule the AE on commercial terms.** The line is clear: you own the technical truth, the AE owns the commercial relationship. If the AE wants to offer a 25% discount and you think it's too generous — that's their call. If the AE wants to position the deal as a multi-year commitment and you prefer a shorter pilot — that's their call. Overruling on commercial matters is a boundary violation that will cost you the AE's trust permanently.

> **War Story:** An AE told a prospect that their platform could "replace Informatica entirely" in a data integration evaluation. The SE knew this was a dangerous overclaim — the product could replace about 60% of Informatica's functionality but had no equivalent for several advanced transformation patterns the prospect was using. The SE didn't correct the AE in the meeting. After the call, he sent the AE a message: "I want to make sure we don't over-expose ourselves. We're strong on ETL and real-time streaming but weak on complex transformation orchestration. If they test us on Informatica's PowerCenter-style workflows, we'll fail visibly. Can we reframe as 'complementary to Informatica for modern workloads' instead of 'replacement for Informatica'?" The AE adjusted the positioning. The deal closed — scoped to the workloads where they actually won. If the SE had stayed silent, the POC would have exposed the gap publicly, and the prospect would have lost trust in both the product and the team.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who overrules the AE publicly, in front of the prospect. "Actually, that's not how our product works." Three words. One destroyed partnership. The AE looks incompetent. The SE looks insubordinate. The prospect loses confidence in the team. The correct instinct — protecting technical truth — was executed with the wrong technique. Always correct privately. Always add nuance publicly.

**Interview Angle:**
"Describe a situation where you disagreed with your AE's approach to a deal. What did you do?"
A strong answer describes a specific disagreement, the SE's reasoning, how they communicated it (privately, with data), and the outcome. A weak answer either avoids the topic ("we always agreed") or describes a confrontation without a resolution.

**Practical Reference: The Overrule Decision Matrix**

| Situation | Should You Overrule? | How? |
|-----------|---------------------|------|
| AE makes a false technical claim | Yes, always | Add precision publicly; correct privately |
| AE wants to skip discovery | Yes | Insist on minimum 30-min technical call before demo |
| AE agrees to unfavourable POC terms | Yes | Review criteria before committing; flag risks in writing |
| AE ignores a deal-killing risk | Yes | Document in CRM; escalate to SE manager if unaddressed |
| AE offers an aggressive discount | No | Their domain — raise concerns privately if appropriate |
| AE chooses a deal strategy you disagree with | Depends | Share your perspective with data; defer to them if they're unconvinced |

🟡 **Mid-Level** — The right to overrule is earned. SEs who have a track record of correct judgment get more latitude. Build that track record by being right more often than wrong — and by being graceful when you're wrong.
