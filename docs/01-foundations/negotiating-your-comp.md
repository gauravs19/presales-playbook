#### 1.4.4 Negotiating Your Own Compensation

SEs are among the worst negotiators of their own compensation in enterprise tech. It's ironic — you spend your days helping prospects evaluate million-dollar investments, but when it comes to your own economic value, you accept the first offer, avoid uncomfortable conversations, and leave money on the table because "I don't want to seem greedy."

You are a revenue-generating professional. Your compensation should reflect the revenue you influence. Here's how to negotiate like you'd advise a customer to evaluate a vendor.

1. **Know your market value before the conversation.** Sites like Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Blind, and Repvue provide SE compensation data segmented by company, geography, seniority, and OTE (On-Target Earnings). Before any negotiation — whether a new offer or an annual review — know the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile for your role in your market. If you're being offered below the 50th percentile and you have strong performance data, you have leverage. If you can't find data, ask trusted peers. SEs are unusually transparent about comp with people they trust.

2. **Separate base from variable — and negotiate both.** OTE (On-Target Earnings) = Base + Variable (paid at 100% quota attainment). Most SEs focus on total OTE. Smarter SEs negotiate the split. Why? A higher base provides financial stability. A higher variable provides upside. If you're joining a company with a strong product and high AE win rates, lean toward variable — you'll likely overachieve. If you're joining a startup or a team with unproven pipeline, lean toward base — the variable may never materialise.

3. **Use your impact data as leverage.** Remember the SE Impact Dashboard from Section 1.1.4? This is where it pays off. "In the last 4 quarters, I've influenced $6.2M in closed-won revenue with a 48% technical win rate. My deals close 20% faster than the team average." This isn't bragging. This is evidence. And evidence is the only currency that works in compensation discussions.

4. **Negotiate beyond cash.** If the company can't move on base or variable, negotiate the peripherals: equity/RSUs, signing bonus, professional development budget (conferences, certifications), work-from-home flexibility, or guaranteed territory assignment. These non-cash elements can add $20–50K of equivalent value that the hiring manager has more discretion to approve than base salary increases.

5. **Time your internal raise requests strategically.** The best time to negotiate a raise is immediately after a major deal closes where your contribution is visible. The worst time is during annual review cycles when budgets are already set. If you closed a marquee deal in Q2, request a compensation review in Q3 while the win is fresh in leadership's memory. Don't wait until January when it becomes one data point among many.

> **War Story:** An SE was offered a role at a Series C startup: $165K base, $55K variable, $220K OTE. She knew the market rate for her level was $240K–$260K OTE. Instead of asking for a higher number, she asked for evidence: "What's the average quota attainment on the SE team?" The hiring manager admitted it was 72%. That meant her expected earnings were $165K + ($55K × 0.72) = $204K. She countered: "Given the quota attainment reality, I'd like to restructure to $185K base and $75K variable. That puts my OTE at $260K if I hit target, which is market rate, and my expected at $239K at your team's current attainment." The company agreed. She'd negotiated a $35K increase in expected earnings without demanding an unreasonable OTE — because she negotiated the split, not just the total.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who conflates salary negotiation with self-worth. They don't negotiate because they're afraid that asking for more will be seen as ungrateful, arrogant, or disloyal. So they accept the first offer, watch less experienced colleagues earn more because they negotiated harder, and build quiet resentment that erodes their productivity. No company has ever rescinded an offer because a candidate asked for more money. If they did, you didn't want to work there.

**Interview Angle:**

**Practical Reference: The Compensation Negotiation Prep Sheet**

Before any compensation conversation, complete this:

| Data Point | Your Number | Market Data | Gap |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Current Base | | 50th percentile for role/market | |
| Current Variable | | | |
| Current OTE | | | |
| SE-Influenced Revenue (last 4 quarters) | | | |
| Technical Win Rate | | Team/industry average | |
| Deal Velocity vs. Team | | | |
| Additional Value (mentoring, frameworks, tools built) | | | |

**Your ask should bridge the gap between your data and market data.** If both are aligned, focus on non-cash elements or future equity.

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Your compensation reflects two things: the value you create and the value you negotiate. Most SEs only optimise the first. Optimise both.
