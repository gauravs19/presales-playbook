#### 1.4.1 The 4-Tier Competency Model

Enterprise presales requires mastering four distinct tiers of competency, stacked in order of complexity. Most SEs are strong in the first two tiers and structurally weak in the latter two — because nobody teaches tiers 3 and 4. They're acquired through experience, mentoring, and deliberate practice. This model gives you the architecture for a career-long development plan.

1. **Tier 1: Product & Technology Fluency.** You know what your product does, how it works, and where it sits in the competitive landscape. You can answer feature questions, explain architecture concepts, and demonstrate core use cases. This is table stakes. Every SE on your team has Tier 1 competency. If you're still building this tier after 6 months, you're behind. Assessment: Can you demo any of your top 5 use cases from memory, handle 80% of questions without looking anything up, and explain your competitive differentiation to a technical evaluator? If yes, Tier 1 is solid.

2. **Tier 2: Presales Process Mastery.** You know how to run a deal cycle — discovery, demo, POC, proposal support — with discipline and repeatability. You prepare for meetings, you follow up systematically, your CRM notes are useful, and your discovery uncovers real pain not surface-level symptoms. This tier is where most SEs operate for the majority of their career. Assessment: Can you run a full deal cycle from first meeting to technical win with no senior SE oversight? If yes, Tier 2 is solid.

3. **Tier 3: Commercial & Strategic Acumen.** You understand how your technical work connects to commercial outcomes. You can quantify business impact, shape evaluation criteria, influence pricing discussions, and position your solution against competitive alternatives using business language rather than feature comparisons. You read the prospect's 10-K. You understand their industry's regulatory landscape. You know whether their fiscal year end aligns with your close plan. Assessment: have you built a value narrative or ROI model that directly influenced a deal outcome in the last two quarters? If yes, Tier 3 is emerging.

4. **Tier 4: Organisational & Market Influence.** You shape how your company sells, what your company builds, and how your market evolves. You contribute to product roadmap discussions with credible field intelligence. You mentor SEs across the team and set standards that others follow. You have relationships with industry analysts, customers, and partners that extend beyond any single deal. Assessment: does your product team seek your input on feature prioritisation? Does your VP of Sales ask for your opinion on go-to-market strategy? If yes, Tier 4 is established.

**The Progression Trap:** Most SEs try to deepen Tier 1 endlessly — becoming the team's deepest technical expert — instead of broadening into Tiers 3 and 4. Technical depth has diminishing returns beyond a threshold. The SE who knows 95% of the product isn't meaningfully more effective than the SE who knows 85% of the product. But the SE who adds commercial acumen and organisational influence to 85% product knowledge is dramatically more valuable than both.

> **War Story:** Two SEs were up for the same promotion. SE #1 was the team's best technical resource — she could deep-dive into any architectural discussion, had the most certifications, and was the go-to for complex technical questions. SE #2 was technically solid but not exceptional. However, SE #2 had built a competitive positioning framework that the entire team adopted, had co-developed a pricing model with the finance team, and had mentored 3 junior SEs to independence. The promotion went to SE #2. The feedback to SE #1: "You're the best at Tier 1 on the team. But the Principal role requires Tiers 3 and 4." SE #1 was frustrated. She'd invested years deepening her technical knowledge while the promotion criteria had quietly shifted to strategic impact.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who mistakes Tier 1 mastery for career advancement. They pursue every certification, attend every product training, and spend weekends learning new technical skills. But they never attend a pipeline review. They never read a prospect's annual report. They never volunteer for a cross-functional project. After 5 years, they're the most technically knowledgeable SE on a team where technical knowledge isn't the bottleneck — deal influence and commercial strategy are.

**Interview Angle:**
"Where do you see yourself needing the most development right now?"
A strong answer maps their development need to a specific tier (or equivalent framework) and describes a concrete plan to address it. A weak answer says "I just need more reps on deals" — which is a Tier 2 answer that signals they haven't thought about Tiers 3 or 4.

**Practical Reference: The 4-Tier Self-Assessment**

| Tier | Competency Area | Key Evidence | My Rating (1-5) |
|------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Product & Technology | Can demo top use cases cold, handle 80% of questions | |
| 2 | Presales Process | Can run discovery-to-win independently | |
| 3 | Commercial & Strategic | Built ROI model or influenced pricing in last 2 quarters | |
| 4 | Organisational Influence | Product/leadership seeks my input; mentor others | |

**Invest in your lowest-scoring tier.** If Tiers 1 and 2 are 4+ and Tiers 3 and 4 are 2 or below, you've found your bottleneck.

🟡 **Mid-Level** — The 4-Tier Model is not a test. It's a diagnostic. Use it quarterly to check whether your development efforts are aligned with your career trajectory.
