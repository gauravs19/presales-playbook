#### 1.2.4 Establishing Deal Swimlanes That Actually Hold

Every SE/AE partnership needs swimlanes — defined areas of ownership that prevent stepping on each other's toes, eliminate duplicated effort, and create a unified customer experience. The problem isn't that teams don't have swimlanes. The problem is that the swimlanes are vague, undocumented, and violated the moment pressure increases.

Swimlanes that "actually hold" are explicitly agreed upon, documented, and enforced — especially during deal crises when the temptation to abandon them is strongest.

1. **The AE owns the opening and closing. The SE owns the middle.** The simplest swimlane definition: the AE opens relationships, sets commercial context, explores budget, and drives the contract to signature. The SE owns discovery, solution design, demonstration, POC, and technical validation. The grey zone — where most conflicts occur — is the transition between discovery and proposal. Both parties think they own "shaping the solution for the prospect." Define who leads each part explicitly.

2. **The AE owns stakeholder access. The SE owns stakeholder trust.** The AE should be the one requesting introductions to the economic buyer, setting up meetings with procurement, and navigating the political landscape. The SE should be the one earning technical credibility in those meetings through depth, preparation, and precision. When an SE starts scheduling meetings independently without the AE's knowledge, the partnership fractures. When an AE gatekeeps the SE from talking to technical evaluators, the deal suffers.

3. **Meeting roles should be pre-agreed, not improvised.** Before every customer meeting, spend 5 minutes aligning: "I'll open with context and introductions. You take discovery from minute 5. I'll handle questions about pricing and next steps. You handle all technical questions." This prevents the two most common meeting dysfunctions: the AE and SE talking over each other (the prospect watches two people compete for airtime), and dead silence when neither person thinks they're supposed to respond.

4. **Document the swimlanes for every deal, not just the team.** Generic team-level swimlanes break down because every deal is different. A deal with a strong champion requires different AE/SE coordination than a deal where you're fighting uphill against a detractor. At the start of every deal, co-create a brief deal plan that includes role assignments for each milestone: "AE leads champion coaching. SE leads technical evaluation. Both attend executive briefing. AE leads proposal walkthrough. SE leads POC execution."

5. **Enforce swimlanes when they're violated, not after the deal is lost.** The first time an AE makes a technical claim they shouldn't have, address it that day. The first time an SE sends a commercial email without the AE's input, address it that day. Small violations that go uncorrected become cultural norms. Cultural norms become deal-killing habits. Enforcement isn't confrontation — it's a 3-minute conversation: "Hey, I noticed you jumped into the architecture discussion during the call. I know it came naturally, but that's my lane — if I'm not leading the technical narrative, the prospect gets inconsistent depth. Can we keep to the plan next time?"

> **War Story:** An AE and SE had an unspoken swimlane agreement: the AE handled "business conversations" and the SE handled "technical conversations." The problem surfaced when the prospect's CTO asked a question that was both: "If we go with your platform, what's the business case for replacing our current system — how do we justify the migration cost?" The AE looked at the SE. The SE looked at the AE. Three seconds of silence. The CTO said, "Does anyone want to take that?" Both answered simultaneously with conflicting framings. The CTO lost confidence in the team's alignment. After the meeting, the AE and SE sat down and redefined their swimlanes with a new rule: "If a question bridges business and technical, the SE provides the technical substance and the AE wraps it in commercial context." No more silence. No more collisions.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who resists swimlanes because they view them as constraints on their autonomy. "I should be able to talk about anything in the meeting — I'm not going to stay silent when I have something valuable to add." This SE consistently talks over the AE, answers commercial questions they shouldn't be answering, and creates a meeting dynamic where the prospect hears two competing narratives. The AE eventually requests a different SE. Not because the SE was wrong — but because working with them was exhausting.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you define roles and responsibilities with your AE partner on a deal?"
A strong answer describes a specific, pre-agreed framework (deal plans with role assignments, pre-meeting alignment calls, documented swimlanes). A weak answer says "we just figure it out as we go."

**Practical Reference: The Deal Swimlane Template**

| Deal Stage | AE Leads | SE Leads | Shared |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Initial qualification | Budget, authority, timeline | Technical fit assessment | Champion identification |
| Discovery | Business pain, org dynamics | Technical architecture, integrations, security | Pain quantification |
| Demo | Opening, agenda, commercial framing | Product narrative, technical depth, objection handling | Next step commitment |
| POC | Executive sponsorship, resource commitment | Criteria design, execution, daily standups | Mid-POC checkpoint with champion |
| Proposal | Pricing, terms, commercial negotiation | Technical scope, architecture documentation | Final presentation |
| Procurement | Contract red-lining, legal negotiation | Security questionnaires, technical addenda | Timeline management |

Print this. Fill it in for each deal. Review it when conflicts arise. It takes 10 minutes to complete and prevents weeks of friction.

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Swimlanes are not about control. They're about predictability. A prospect who interacts with a well-coordinated AE/SE pair feels like they're working with a team. A prospect who interacts with an uncoordinated pair feels like they're watching an internal argument.
