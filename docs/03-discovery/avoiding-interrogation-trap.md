#### 3.2.3 Avoiding the Interrogation Trap

There's a fine line between thorough discovery and interrogation. The SE who asks 25 questions in 30 minutes, each answered with a word or a sentence, isn't doing discovery — they're conducting a deposition. The prospect feels grilled, not understood. They give shorter answers. They withhold information. They mentally check out while physically remaining on the call.

The interrogation trap is the most common discovery dysfunction, and it's caused by well-intentioned SEs who confuse quantity of questions with quality of insight.

1. **Recognise the signals.** You're in the interrogation trap if: the prospect's answers are getting shorter, the prospect is starting sentences with "as I mentioned earlier" (they feel you're not listening), the conversation has no natural pauses, you're writing more than the prospect is talking, or the prospect's energy is noticeably lower than when the call started.

2. **The 3:1 ratio rule.** For every 3 questions you ask, share one insight. Instead of asking question after question, interrupt your own sequence with a relevant observation: "That resonates with what I've seen at other companies in your space — the schema drift problem tends to compound because each change creates a cascading failure in downstream transformations. Is that what you're experiencing?" This converts the dynamic from interviewer/subject to two professionals having a conversation. The insight demonstrates that you're not just collecting data — you're processing it in real time.

3. **Use statements to unlock admissions.** Instead of asking "Is your pipeline unreliable?", try: "In most companies with your architecture pattern, the pipeline reliability is around 85–90% — which means roughly 10–15% of jobs fail and need manual recovery. That's usually the hidden tax that engineering absorbs." Then pause. The prospect will either confirm ("That's about right — maybe even worse") or correct ("Actually, we're closer to 75%, which is why this is urgent"). Both responses give you more information than the direct question would — and neither feels like an interrogation.

4. **Create space for the prospect to think.** After asking a substantive question, wait. Count to 5 in your head. Most SEs panic at 3 seconds of silence and fill it with another question or a clarification. Don't. The prospect is thinking. Their next sentence — the one that comes after the pause — is usually the most valuable thing they'll say all meeting. It's the thought they weren't planning to share, the admission they haven't previously verbalised, the real answer that lives underneath the polished first response.

5. **Alternate between directed and open questions.** A directed question: "How long does your batch processing window run?" An open question: "Tell me about what happens when something goes wrong in that process." Directed questions collect specific data points. Open questions reveal narratives, emotions, and context. A discovery that's entirely directed feels like a survey. A discovery that alternates between both feels like a dialogue.

> **War Story:** An SE recorded one of his discovery calls (with permission) and reviewed the transcript. He'd asked 22 questions in 28 minutes. The prospect's average response length: 12 seconds. In a 28-minute call, the prospect spoke for approximately 4 minutes. The SE spoke for 24 minutes — mostly asking questions, restating questions, and asking follow-up questions before the prospect had finished answering the previous one. His discovery notes were thin because the prospect never had space to say anything substantive. He implemented two changes: he limited himself to 10 questions per 30-minute discovery, and he added a 5-second silence rule after each answer. His next discovery call: 10 questions, prospect spoke for 18 minutes, and the depth of information was 3x richer. Fewer questions. More silence. Better discovery.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who equates "thorough discovery" with "long list of questions asked." They leave the call having checked every box on their discovery template — tech stack, data volumes, user count, budget range, timeline, decision process — but haven't learned anything that a pre-sales form could have captured. Their discovery is efficient at collecting information and terrible at generating insight. The difference: information is data. Insight is understanding. Discovery produces insight, not data.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you balance asking thorough discovery questions without making the prospect feel interrogated?"
A strong answer describes specific techniques (3:1 ratio, silence, alternating question types, sharing insights). A weak answer doesn't recognise the interrogation trap as a real problem.

**Practical Reference: The Anti-Interrogation Checklist**

| Technique | How | When |
|-----------|-----|------|
| 3:1 ratio | After every 3 questions, share a relevant insight | Throughout |
| 5-second silence | After every substantive answer, count to 5 before speaking | After open questions |
| Statement-then-pause | Replace direct questions with observations + silence | When probing for sensitive information |
| Open/directed alternation | Alternate between specific data questions and narrative questions | Every 2–3 questions |
| Check-in | "Is there anything else about that situation I should know?" | After each major topic area |

🟢 **Entry-Level** — Great discovery sounds like a conversation where the prospect does 60% of the talking. If you're doing more than 40%, slow down.
