# Questioning Techniques in Presales Discovery

Mastering discovery questions is the cornerstone of successful presales engineering and enterprise architecture. The goal is to move beyond superficial feature requirements and uncover deep, actionable business pain points.

## The Funnel Approach

A highly effective discovery process follows the "Funnel" methodology—starting broad to understand the business context, then narrowing down to specific technical pain points and requirements.

### 1. Open-Ended Questions (Top of Funnel)
Used to establish rapport, map the current state, and get the prospect talking.
- *“Can you walk me through your current process for [X]?”*
- *“What are the key strategic initiatives your team is focused on this year?”*
- *“How does this project align with your broader enterprise architecture goals?”*
- *“What prompted you to start looking for a solution now?”*

### 2. Probing Questions (Middle of Funnel)
Used to dig deeper into the pain, uncover underlying causes, and identify who is affected.
- *“You mentioned [Issue]. Can you give me a specific example of when that happened?”*
- *“How much time/money does your team spend dealing with [Pain Point] each week?”*
- *“When the system goes down, who handles the escalation and what is the business impact?”*
- *“What workarounds are your engineers currently using to bypass this limitation?”*

### 3. Confirming/Closed Questions (Bottom of Funnel)
Used to validate your understanding, gain agreement, and transition to solution mappings.
- *“So, if I understand correctly, reducing deployment times by 50% would save you [X amount] quarterly. Is that accurate?”*
- *“Is it fair to say that without resolving the data siloing issue, compliance reporting will remain a critical risk?”*

## Strategic Frameworks for Discovery

To ensure discovery is comprehensive, Enterprise Architects and Presales Engineers often rely on established frameworks.

### The MEDDPICC Framework
MEDDPICC is a leading enterprise sales methodology that presales professionals deeply participate in:

- **Metrics**: What are the quantifiable measures of success? *(e.g., Target ROI, SLA improvements, latency reduction)*
- **Economic Buyer**: Who holds the budget and final sign-off? Have we validated the solution’s financial impact with them?
- **Decision Criteria**: What exact technical, business, and legal criteria are required to win?
- **Decision Process**: How does the organization evaluate, select, and purchase?
- **Paper Process**: What are the procurement, infosec, and legal hurdles?
- **Identify Pain**: What is the root business problem driving the project? (No pain, no change)
- **Champion**: Who is selling on our behalf when we aren't in the room? Do they have influence?
- **Competition**: Who else are they evaluating (including the option of "Do Nothing" or "Build In-House")?

### TEDW Questioning Technique
A technique to keep questions conversational rather than sounding like an interrogation:

- **T - "Tell me..."**: *"Tell me about the architecture of your current multi-cloud environment."*
- **E - "Explain..."**: *"Explain how your team currently handles incident response."*
- **D - "Describe..."**: *"Describe a perfect state for your CI/CD pipeline."*
- **W - "Walk me through..."**: *"Walk me through the steps an end-user takes when they encounter an error."*

## Handling Resistance in Discovery

Sometimes prospects are guarded. Here’s how to navigate resistance:

1. **"Give to Get"**: Share a brief insight about how similar companies solve the problem before asking your question. 
   > *"Many of our telecom clients struggle with stale cache data during failovers. Is that something your team experiences when routing traffic globally?"*
2. **The "Columbo" Technique**: Adopt a slightly self-deprecating tone to disarm prospects.
   > *"Forgive me, I just want to make sure I’m completely understanding the backend flow here..."*
3. **Hypothetical Reframing**:
   > *"If you had a magic wand and could instantly fix one bottleneck in your data ingestion layer, what would it be?"*

## Next Steps
Once discovery questions yield the necessary technical and business criteria, map these findings into the **[Solution Design Document](../04-solution-design/technical-documentation.md)**.
