#### 3.6.2 The Internal Discovery Debrief

The discovery call just ended. The prospect drops off. Usually, the AE and SE stay on the line for 2 minutes: "That went well! They liked the vision. I'll send the summary. Talk tomorrow." This is not a debrief. This is a mutual validation session. It feels good, but it produces zero strategic value and leaves both parties with different assumptions about what just happened.

A professional internal debrief takes 10 minutes and requires structural conflict. The AE's job is to see the opportunity. The SE's job is to see the gaps. If your debriefs are entirely agreeable, someone isn't doing their job.

1. **Schedule the debrief block.** The discovery meeting isn't 30 minutes; it's 45 minutes. Thirty minutes with the prospect, 15 minutes of blocked time immediately afterward for the AE and SE. If you schedule back-to-back discovery calls without debrief blocks, the nuance of the first call is entirely erased by the second call. You will lose the deal intelligence you just generated.

2. **The AE's perspective (Opportunity).** The debrief starts with the AE: "What did we hear that tells us this deal is real?" The AE focuses on budget signals, timeline catalysts, business pain, and champion dynamics. "The VP confirmed their month-end close delay is costing $144K annually, and they need a solution in place before the Q4 audit. The urgency is there."

3. **The SE's perspective (Risk).** The SE role in the debrief is to play devil's advocate. "What did we hear that tells us this deal might fail?" Focus on technical gaps, unaddressed stakeholders, and integration risks. "The pain is real, but their architecture relies on three legacy mainframes that we struggle to integrate with. Also, the Principal Security Architect was on the call but didn't speak once. We have a silent detractor risk." This isn't pessimism — it's structural risk assessment.

4. **Align on the "Go / No-Go" decision.** Not every discovery call warrants a next step. The debrief is the moment to decide if the deal meets your investment threshold. "Does this deal deserve a custom demo and a POC?" If the AE says "yes" but the SE points out a hard security qualifier gap (e.g., they require on-premise deployment, and you're cloud-only), the decision must be "no-go" or "conditional advance." If you advance a deal with a hard-qualifier gap, you are building pipeline fiction.

5. **Assign clear next steps.** If the decision is "go," assign the follow-up tasks immediately. "I'll write the 1-page discovery summary and send it to you by 3 PM. You review and forward it to the champion by 5 PM. I will outline the demo agenda and we can review it tomorrow at 10 AM." Leaving the debrief without named owners and deadlines guarantees that momentum will stall.

> **War Story:** An AE and SE hung up after a discovery call with a major retailer. The AE said: "That was incredible. They loved the analytics capabilities. They want a demo next Tuesday. Let's start building it." The SE paused and ran the debrief process: "Hold on. They loved the analytics, yes. But when I asked about their data warehouse, they said they're locked into a 3-year contract with [Competitor] and have no budget to replace it. We only sell our analytics on top of our own warehouse. If they can't buy our warehouse, they can't use our analytics." The AE had heard the excitement; the SE had heard the hard qualifier. They agreed to email the prospect and clarify the prerequisite. The prospect confirmed they couldn't buy the warehouse. The deal was killed the same day. The 10-minute debrief saved the SE 15 hours of demo preparation for a deal that was structurally impossible to win.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who defers entirely to the AE's interpretation of the call. The AE says "Great call, let's schedule a POC," and the SE agrees, even though they know the prospect's legacy API won't support the required throughput. The SE stays silent because they don't want to "kill the vibe" or be seen as negative. They end up running a 4-week POC that fails for exactly the reason they suspected in minute 20 of the discovery call.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you process information with your AE immediately after a discovery call?"
A strong answer describes a structured debrief where the SE explicitly plays the role of risk identifier, balancing the AE's opportunity focus. A weak answer says "we chat about next steps."

**Practical Reference: The 10-Minute Internal Debrief Agenda**

| Question | Owner | Focus | Time |
|----------|-------|-------|------|
| "What makes this deal real?" | AE | Pain, budget, timeline | 2 mins |
| "What could kill this deal?" | SE | Tech gaps, security, unmapped stakeholders | 3 mins |
| "What information are we missing?" | Both | Gaps in our DART framework | 2 mins |
| "Go / No-Go for next step?" | Both | Does this meet our investment threshold? | 1 min |
| "Who is doing what today?" | Both | Summary, follow-ups, prep | 2 mins |

🟡 **Mid-Level** — The AE's job is to find reasons to advance the deal. The SE's job is to find reasons the deal might fail. When both do their jobs in the debrief, truth emerges.
