#### 3.5.2 Building a Defensible ROI Case

A good ROI case persuades. A defensible ROI case survives scrutiny — from the CFO who challenges your assumptions, from the procurement team who negotiates against your numbers, and from the detractor who wants to poke holes in your justification. The difference is methodology.

Most SE-built ROI models are aspirational: optimistic assumptions, inflated savings, and timelines that assume perfect execution. A defensible ROI model uses conservative assumptions, cites the prospect's own data, and separates hard savings from soft benefits.

1. **Use the prospect's numbers, not yours.** The most defensible ROI model uses data the prospect provided during discovery. "Your team told us they spend 20 hours/week on manual remediation" is unassailable. "Based on industry benchmarks, teams typically spend 20 hours/week" is arguable. Whenever possible, attribute every number in your ROI model to a specific discovery conversation: "Per our discussion on March 12, your Director of Data Engineering confirmed that pipeline failures cost an average of $15K per incident."

2. **Separate hard savings from soft benefits.** Hard savings: quantifiable, measurable, and directly attributable to the solution. "Eliminating 20 hours/week of manual remediation saves $100K/year." Soft benefits: real but harder to measure. "Faster reporting enables better decision-making." CFOs trust hard savings. They discount soft benefits. Lead with hard savings in your ROI model. Include soft benefits as supplementary value — not as the primary justification.

3. **Use conservative multipliers.** If the prospect says manual remediation takes 20 hours/week, use 15 in your model. If they say each incident costs $15K, use $12K. When the CFO challenges your ROI — "These numbers seem inflated" — you can respond: "We actually used numbers 20–25% below what your team reported, specifically to be conservative. Even with these reduced assumptions, the ROI is 3.5:1." Conservative assumptions make the model bulletproof.

4. **Include implementation costs.** An ROI model that shows only the benefits without the costs is a marketing document, not a financial analysis. Include: license cost, implementation cost (both vendor and internal resources), training cost, opportunity cost of internal team time during implementation, and any infrastructure costs (cloud compute, additional storage). The net ROI = (Total Annual Savings - Total Annual Cost) / Total Annual Cost. If your ROI is positive after all costs, it's credible.

5. **Project over 3 years, show value by quarter.** CFOs think in fiscal years and investment horizons. A 3-year ROI model shows the total return over a reasonable investment period. Breaking it down by quarter shows when the prospect starts seeing value: "You'll see initial value in Q2 after Phase 1 deployment. By Q4, you'll have achieved full annual savings. The 3-year ROI is 4.2:1 with a payback period of 11 months."

> **War Story:** An SE built an ROI model for a healthcare company that showed a 6:1 return. The CFO's first reaction: "I've never seen a vendor ROI model that wasn't inflated. Walk me through your assumptions." The SE opened the model and walked through each line: "This $180K savings comes from eliminating 22 hours/week of manual reconciliation, which your VP of Data Engineering confirmed in our March 5 discovery call. We reduced it from 22 to 18 hours in our model to be conservative. At your company's standard fully loaded engineering cost of $95/hour — a number your finance team provided — that's $89K per year for this line item alone." The CFO's response: "That's the first ROI model a vendor has shown me that used our numbers instead of theirs." The deal closed at the proposed price without discount negotiation — because the ROI model had already justified the investment.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who builds ROI models with inflated assumptions because they want the ROI number to be impressive. "We can reduce your processing time by 90%, saving $2M per year." The CFO challenges it. The SE can't defend the assumptions. The credibility of the entire evaluation drops. An ROI model that over-promises is worse than no ROI model at all — because it signals that you're more interested in selling than in accuracy.

**Interview Angle:**
"Have you built an ROI model for a deal? Walk me through the methodology."
A strong answer describes using the prospect's own data, conservative assumptions, separated hard/soft savings, and full cost inclusion. A weak answer describes using vendor templates with standard industry assumptions.

**Practical Reference: The Defensible ROI Model Template**

| Category | Line Item | Source | Conservative Estimate | Annual Value |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Hard Savings** | | | | |
| | Eliminated manual remediation | Prospect discovery (March 5) | 18 hrs/week × $95/hr | $89,000 |
| | Reduced incident cost | Prospect data (4 incidents/qtr × $12K) | | $48,000 |
| | Faster month-end close | Prospect finance team | 2 days × $12K × 12 | $144,000 |
| **Soft Benefits** | | | | |
| | Accelerated strategic project | Prospect CTO priority | Estimated value: TBD | $300,000 (est.) |
| **Total Annual Benefit** | | | | **$581,000** |
| **Costs** | | | | |
| | Annual license | Proposal | | ($180,000) |
| | Implementation (Y1 only) | SOW | | ($75,000) |
| | Internal resources (Y1) | Estimated: 0.5 FTE × 3 months | | ($47,500) |
| **Net Annual Value (Y1)** | | | | **$278,500** |
| **3-Year ROI** | | | | **4.2:1** |

🟡 **Mid-Level** — A defensible ROI model doesn't just justify the purchase. It justifies the price. The SE who builds this model well eliminates the discount conversation before it starts.
