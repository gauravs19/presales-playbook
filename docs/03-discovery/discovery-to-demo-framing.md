#### 3.6.3 Using Discovery Outputs to Frame the Demo

A generic demo says: "Look at what our product can do." A discovery-framed demo says: "Look at how our product solves the specific $144K problem you described last week." The difference in conversion rate between these two demo styles is staggeringly high.

Discovery isn't just an information-gathering exercise; it's the architectural blueprint for your demo. If you do excellent discovery but deliver a standard "harbour tour" demo, you've wasted the intelligence you captured.

1. **The "You said, We heard, Let's show" opening.** Never start a demo by immediately sharing your screen and logging into the product. Start with a slide or a statement that proves you listened. "In our call last Thursday, **you said** that manual schema updates take 6 hours a week. **We heard** that this delay prevents your operations team from getting their morning reports on time. Today, **let's show** how we eliminate that manual step entirely, saving those 6 hours and getting operations their data by 7 AM." This framing anchors everything you are about to show directly to their stated business pain.

2. **Map demo features to specific stakeholders.** If the VP of Finance is joining the demo, don't just show the reporting dashboard. Frame it around their discovery statement: "Sarah, during discovery you mentioned that lack of visibility into real-time spend was your biggest risk. I've configured this dashboard specifically to show how you would track that spend automatically." Tagging a feature with a stakeholder's name and their stated pain point guarantees their attention. It says: "This part of the demo is just for you."

3. **Skip 70% of the product.** If discovery revealed that the prospect's sole problem is data integration, your demo should be 90% data integration. Do not spend 15 minutes demonstrating your machine learning module just because it looks cool. "I've deliberately removed several modules from today's demo, including ML and Advanced Visualisation, because based on our discovery, your immediate priority is integration reliability. We can explore those other areas later if you wish, but today I want to focus 100% on solving the reliability problem." This radical focus builds massive credibility because it proves you aren't a feature-pusher.

4. **Use their terminology.** If the prospect calls their data warehouse "The Hub," you call it "The Hub" in your demo. If they call their customers "Guests," your demo data should say "Guests." If they call their process "The Friday Reconciliation," name your demo workflow "Friday Reconciliation Automation." The psychological gap between "Vendor Product" and "Our Solution" shrinks dramatically when the product speaks the prospect's institutional language.

5. **The "Check-Down" validation.** After demonstrating the solution to a specific pain point mapped in discovery, pause and validate: "We just walked through the automated schema detection. Does this look like it would eliminate the 6 hours of manual work you described last week?" If they say yes, you've earned a micro-commitment. If they say no, or "partially," you catch the gap immediately rather than discovering it three weeks later.

> **War Story:** An SE was preparing a demo for a logistics company. The standard company demo script was 45 minutes long and covered 6 modules. During discovery, the SE learned the prospect only cared about one thing: the inability to track return shipments in real-time, which was costing them $2M annually in lost goods. The SE threw out the standard demo. He built a 15-minute demo focused entirely on the Returns module. He opened the meeting: "I know you booked 60 minutes. But based on our discovery, you have a $2M problem with returns tracking. I'm going to spend 15 minutes showing you exactly how we fix that. If I succeed, we can use the remaining 45 minutes to discuss implementation. If not, I'll give you your time back." The VP of Supply Chain leaned forward in his chair. The SE nailed the 15-minute focused demo. They spent the next 45 minutes discussing commercial terms.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who runs discovery, takes great notes, and then delivers the exact same demo they delivered to the last three prospects. "I know we talked about your data pipeline issues, but first let me show you our new user interface..." The prospect immediately thinks: "They didn't listen. They're just reading a script." The moment you show a feature that doesn't map to a discovered pain, you transition from "trusted advisor" back to "software vendor."

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you prepare for a demo after a completed discovery call?"
A strong answer describes discarding irrelevant features, using the "You said/We show" framework, and aggressively tailoring the narrative to the discovery notes. A weak answer describes "making sure the demo environment works."

**Practical Reference: The Demo Framing Matrix**

| Discovery Finding (The Pain) | Person Stating Pain | Demo Feature (The Solution) | The Audio Track (How I Frame It) |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| "Batch takes 9 hours" | John (Data Eng VP) | Streaming ingestion | "John, you mentioned the 9-hour batch window..." |
| "Reports are 1 day late" | Sarah (Ops Dir) | Real-time views | "Sarah, to solve the 1-day delay you brought up..." |
| "Security audits are manual" | David (CISO) | Compliance dashboard | "David, regarding the manual audits you highlighted..." |

**If a feature on your demo agenda doesn't map to a row on this matrix, delete it from the agenda.**

🟡 **Mid-Level** — A demo is not a product tour. A demo is the visual proof that you understood the discovery.
