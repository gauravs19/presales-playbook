#### 3.4.1 Isolating the True Economic Buyer

The economic buyer is the person who can say "yes" to the expenditure — the person with unilateral authority to approve budget allocation for your deal. In MEDDPICC language, they're the "E." In practical terms, they're the most important person you'll never meet enough.

Most SEs never interact with the economic buyer directly. They deal with the champion, the technical evaluators, and occasionally the champion's manager. The economic buyer exists somewhere above — making the decision based on information filtered through layers of internal communication. Your job is to identify them, understand what they care about, and arm your champion to sell to them.

1. **The economic buyer is not always who the AE thinks it is.** AEs often identify the economic buyer based on title — "the VP of Engineering" or "the CTO." But budget authority doesn't always follow the org chart. In many organisations, budget for technology purchases sits with the business line (the VP of Operations, the CMO, or the CFO), not with the technology team. The CTO may have a strong opinion about which product to buy, but the budget to buy it comes from a different pocket. Ask the champion: "When the purchase order is created, whose budget does it come from?" That person is the economic buyer.

2. **Test with the "funding question."** "If your evaluation concludes that our solution is the best fit, who signs off on the expenditure?" This is a cleaner question than "who is the decision-maker?" because decision-making is collaborative (many people influence it) while expenditure authority is specific (one person controls the budget). The champion's answer reveals the true economic buyer — and often reveals that the champion doesn't know, which is itself a critical data point.

3. **Understand what the economic buyer measures.** Economic buyers don't care about features, architecture elegance, or technical differentiators. They care about: time to value ("how quickly does this generate return?"), risk mitigation ("what happens if it fails?"), total cost of ownership ("what's the all-in cost over 3 years, including implementation?"), and strategic alignment ("does this support our company's stated priorities?"). Your champion's pitch to the economic buyer must be in this language, not in technical language. If you arm your champion with a technical architecture document, they'll struggle. If you arm them with a one-page business impact summary, they'll have a tool designed for the audience.

4. **Create the artefact the economic buyer will read.** The economic buyer will receive a packet of information from the champion. Most of that packet will be ignored. The one document they will read is the executive summary — a single page that answers: what is the problem (in business terms), what is the proposed solution (in outcome terms, not feature terms), what does it cost, what does it save, and what is the timeline to value. You should write this document — not the AE, not the champion — because you're the person who best understands the technical solution and the quantified pain.

5. **Seek a direct interaction when possible.** The most effective deal acceleration is a direct meeting between your team and the economic buyer. An Executive Briefing — a 30-minute session where you present the business case (not the product) to the economic buyer — can compress weeks of internal selling into a single conversation. Not every deal warrants this, and not every champion can arrange it. But when it's possible, it's the highest-ROI meeting in the deal cycle.

> **War Story:** An SE was working a deal where the champion insisted the CTO was the economic buyer. For 3 months, the SE designed the architecture, built the POC, and framed the value narrative for a CTO audience. When the deal reached procurement, it was denied. Not by the CTO — by the CFO, who had never been briefed and didn't understand why $800K of IT budget should go to a data pipeline tool. The CTO had influence. The CFO had the budget. The SE had been selling to the wrong person's priorities for an entire quarter. After the deal was revived (3 weeks of emergency executive briefings), the SE now asks every champion: "Walk me through the approval process for a purchase of this size. Who has to say yes, and in what order?"

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who assumes the champion can sell internally without help. Champions are technically competent, but they rarely have practice presenting business cases to their CFO. They'll present the architecture diagram instead of the business impact summary. They'll lead with features instead of outcomes. They'll answer "why this product?" instead of "why this investment now?" Arm them. Coach them. Give them the document they need.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you identify and engage the economic buyer in your deals?"
A strong answer describes specific techniques (the funding question, executive briefing, champion coaching). A weak answer conflates the decision committee with the economic buyer.

**Practical Reference: The Economic Buyer Discovery Questions**

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| "When the purchase order is created, whose budget does it come from?" | Identify the actual budget owner |
| "What's the approval process for a purchase of this size?" | Map the funding chain |
| "Has your [EB title] been briefed on this initiative?" | Assess EB awareness |
| "What does your [EB title] care about most this year?" | Align your value narrative |
| "Would an executive briefing for your leadership be valuable?" | Create direct access |

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Deals are won in the evaluation. Deals are funded by the economic buyer. If you only focus on the first, you'll win evaluations that never get funded.
