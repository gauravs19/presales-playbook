#### 3.1.3 Mapping Political Landmines Before You Walk In

Every organisation has politics. Every deal is influenced by those politics. The SE who ignores the political landscape and focuses exclusively on technical merit will be blindsided by decisions that "don't make sense" — because they make perfect sense when you understand the power dynamics behind them.

Political mapping isn't manipulation. It's situational awareness. You can't navigate a minefield you can't see.

1. **Ask the champion directly.** Most SEs are afraid to ask about internal politics because it feels invasive. It's not — it's practical. "Who in your organisation might have concerns about this project, and why?" Champions will tell you because they're navigating the same politics daily. Common answers: "Our VP of Infrastructure doesn't want to move to the cloud because he built the on-prem environment." "The CISO is suspicious of any vendor that isn't on the approved list." "The Director of Data Engineering just joined from [Competitor], and she's loyal to their platform." Each of these is a political landmine that will detonate during your evaluation if you don't see it coming.

2. **Map the decision-making axis.** In every deal, there are two axes of power: formal authority (who has the title and budget to approve the purchase) and informal influence (who shapes opinions and can block decisions without formal authority). These often don't overlap. The CTO has formal authority but the Principal Engineer has informal influence — because the CTO trusts her judgement and won't approve anything she vetoes. If you're only engaging the CTO, you're missing the actual decision-maker.

3. **Identify the "build vs. buy" advocate.** In almost every enterprise deal, someone on the prospect's side believes they can build the solution internally. This person is the most dangerous political opponent — not because they're wrong (sometimes they're right), but because their opposition is deeply personal. They're not just evaluating your product; they're defending their team's capability and their own relevance. Engage them with respect: "Your team clearly has the expertise to build this. The question isn't capability — it's bandwidth and opportunity cost. What would your engineers build if they weren't building this?"

4. **Watch for the silent veto.** Some stakeholders won't say a word during your evaluation. They'll attend meetings, listen quietly, and never raise an objection. Then, in the internal decision meeting that you're not invited to, they'll say: "I don't think this is the right solution." And the deal dies. Silent vetoes come from people who feel they weren't adequately consulted or whose concerns were never addressed. Your defence: at the end of every multi-stakeholder meeting, go around the room: "Is there anything we haven't addressed that's important to you?" Direct the question at the quiet ones. If they have a concern, surface it now — not in a meeting you'll never attend.

5. **Map the political landscape visually.** Create a simple influence map for every deal with 4+ stakeholders. For each person: their name, their role, their formal authority level, their informal influence level, their stance (advocate / neutral / sceptic / blocker), and their primary motivator (career advancement, risk avoidance, team protection, budget conservation). Review this map before every meeting and update it after.

> **War Story:** An SE was running a deal at a large insurance company. The champion — a Senior Director — was enthusiastic. The CTO was supportive. The discovery was excellent. The POC was successful. Two weeks before the expected close, the deal was killed. The SE was devastated. In the debrief, the champion revealed: "The VP of Enterprise Architecture vetoed the project. He was never in any of our meetings because we didn't think his approval was needed. But it turns out, any new infrastructure purchase over $200K requires his sign-off." The SE had mapped the champion and the CTO but missed a stakeholder with veto authority who'd never been visible. The VP's concern — a valid one about integration with their existing service mesh — was never addressed because nobody knew to address it. One unmapped stakeholder. One invisible veto. One dead deal.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who assumes that enthusiasm from the champion means alignment across the organisation. "Our champion loves us, so the deal will close." Champions don't close deals. Organisations close deals — and organisations are made up of people with competing priorities, insecurities, and career ambitions. If your champion is the only person in the room when the decision is made, their voice is one among many. Map the many.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you navigate internal politics within a prospect's organisation?"
A strong answer describes proactive political mapping (asking the champion, identifying informal influencers, watching for silent vetoes). A weak answer says "I focus on the technical merits and let the AE handle the politics."

**Practical Reference: The Political Influence Map**

| Name | Title | Formal Authority (1-5) | Informal Influence (1-5) | Stance | Primary Motivator | Risk | My Last Contact |
|------|-------|----------------------|------------------------|--------|-------------------|------|----------------|
| | CTO | 5 | 4 | Advocate | Innovation | Low | |
| | VP Infra | 4 | 5 | Sceptic | Team protection | High — potential veto | |
| | Dir. Data Eng | 3 | 3 | Neutral | Career advance | Medium | |
| | Principal Eng | 2 | 5 | Unknown | Technical quality | High — informal authority | |
| | CISO | 4 | 3 | Unknown | Risk avoidance | Medium — compliance gate | |

**Gaps in this map = gaps in your deal awareness. Fill them before they become surprises.**

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Political mapping isn't optional presales work. It's the work that determines whether your technical win converts to a commercial win or dies in a conference room you were never invited to.
