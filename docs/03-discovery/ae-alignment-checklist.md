#### 3.1.4 The Pre-Flight AE Alignment Checklist

The 5 minutes before a discovery call are the most frequently wasted 5 minutes in presales. The AE is multitasking. The SE is reviewing notes. Neither has confirmed: who's opening, who's asking what, what the call's objective is, or what the agreed next step should be. The result is a meeting where two professionals improvise in front of a prospect — and improvisation in enterprise sales is just a polite word for unpreparedness.

The Pre-Flight Alignment takes 5 minutes. It prevents 50 minutes of dysfunction.

1. **Confirm the call objective.** Not "learn about them." A specific, measurable objective: "Confirm whether they have a data pipeline scaling problem, identify who owns the budget, and propose a technical deep-dive as the next step." If the AE's objective is "build rapport" and yours is "run technical discovery," you need to reconcile before the call starts, not during it.

2. **Agree on roles and flow.** "You open with 3 minutes of context and agenda. I take over at minute 5 with discovery questions. You handle any pricing questions — if they ask me, I'll redirect to you. I'll drive the next step proposal at minute 25." This script takes 30 seconds to agree on and prevents the two most common meeting dysfunctions: talking over each other and awkward silences when neither person knows whose turn it is.

3. **Share your hypothesis with the AE.** "Based on my research, I think their main pain is the batch processing bottleneck. I'm going to test that hypothesis in the first 10 minutes." This gives the AE context to support your line of questioning rather than derail it. If the AE has contradicting information — "Actually, the champion told me it's about data governance, not batch processing" — better to know now than in minute 15 of the call.

4. **Align on the "walk-away" signal.** Sometimes, mid-discovery, it becomes clear that the deal isn't real — no pain, no budget, no urgency. Pre-agree on a signal: "If I sense this is exploratory with no near-term action, I'll start wrapping up at minute 15 instead of running the full 30. When I say 'Let me make sure we're focusing on what's most valuable for you,' that's my cue that I'm about to redirect." This prevents the SE from running a full discovery on a non-deal while the AE sits there hoping for a different outcome.

5. **Confirm what "success" looks like.** What needs to be true at the end of this call for it to have been worth everyone's time? "Success is: we've confirmed a quantifiable pain, identified the next stakeholder to engage, and scheduled a follow-up within 10 business days." If three people spend 30 minutes on a call that produces no next step, that call failed — regardless of how friendly the conversation was.

> **War Story:** An AE and SE walked into a discovery call without aligning. The AE opened with a 10-minute company overview — complete with slides about the founding story, number of customers, and recent awards. The prospect checked her phone at minute 4. When the SE finally got to ask discovery questions at minute 12, the prospect's energy was gone — she'd mentally categorised this as another vendor pitch. The SE salvaged what she could, but the discovery was shallow because trust had been damaged in the opening. After the call, the SE implemented a pre-flight rule: "No call starts without a 5-minute AE/SE alignment. No opening exceeds 3 minutes. Every call starts with a question, not a pitch." The next discovery call with a different prospect: the AE opened with a 90-second agenda, the SE launched the hypothesis at minute 2, and the prospect was engaged for the full 30. Pre-flight alignment isn't bureaucracy — it's quality control.

> **Failure Mode:** The AE who refuses to do pre-flight alignment because "I've been doing this for 15 years — I know how to run a meeting." The result: inconsistent meeting quality, role confusion, and an SE who doesn't know when to speak, what to ask, or what the commercial context is. The AE's experience doesn't eliminate the need for alignment — it makes alignment faster. An experienced pilot still does a pre-flight checklist. An experienced AE should do the same.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you prepare with your AE before a customer meeting?"
A strong answer describes a specific pre-flight process with role definition, hypothesis sharing, and success criteria. A weak answer says "we usually talk briefly before the call" without structure.

**Practical Reference: The 5-Minute Pre-Flight Checklist**

| Item | Time | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Call objective | 30 sec | "Confirm pain, identify budget owner, propose deep-dive" |
| Roles and flow | 30 sec | "AE opens (3 min), SE discovery (20 min), AE next steps (5 min)" |
| Hypothesis shared | 60 sec | "I think their problem is X. AE confirms or adjusts." |
| Walk-away signal | 30 sec | "If I say 'let me focus on what's most valuable,' I'm wrapping early" |
| Success criteria | 30 sec | "Quantified pain + next meeting scheduled within 10 days" |
| Anti-patterns | 60 sec | "Don't answer pricing. Don't demo. Don't promise timelines." |

**Total: 5 minutes. Non-negotiable. Before every call.**

🟢 **Entry-Level** — The pre-flight checklist is the cheapest insurance policy in presales. Five minutes of alignment prevents an hour of dysfunction.
