#### 3.6.1 Writing the Discovery Summary That Gets Read

You've completed a thorough discovery. You have pages of notes, quantified pain metrics, stakeholder insights, and architectural understanding. Now you need to turn all of that into a single document that three different audiences will read: the champion (who needs ammunition to sell internally), the AE (who needs commercial context for their strategy), and the decision-maker (who needs a reason to spend money).

The discovery summary is not a transcript of your meeting. It's a strategic document designed to advance the deal.

1. **Keep it to one page (maximum two).** No executive — internal or external — reads a 5-page discovery summary. They skim the first paragraph, scan the headers, and read the conclusion. Design accordingly: one page of substance with clear headers, bullet points, and a final recommendation.

2. **Structure: Problem → Impact → Proposed Next Step.** The document should follow this flow:
   - **Current State**: 3–4 sentences describing the prospect's current environment and the specific challenges surfaced during discovery.
   - **Quantified Impact**: The dollar cost, time cost, or risk exposure of the current challenges (citing specific metrics from discovery).
   - **Proposed Solution Approach**: 2–3 sentences describing how your solution addresses the stated challenges (framed in outcomes, not features).
   - **Recommended Next Step**: A specific, time-bound action with a proposed date.

3. **Write for the champion's forwarding use case.** The champion will forward this document to their leadership. When they do, the document needs to stand alone — without your verbal context, without a demo, and without the champion's commentary. If someone reads this document with no prior context and understands the problem, the impact, and the proposed path forward, you've written it correctly. If they need explanation, it's too dense, too technical, or too long.

4. **Include the prospect's words.** Reference specific statements from the discovery: "As [Name] described, your team spends approximately 22 hours per week on manual data reconciliation across your three ERP systems." Using the prospect's own language builds credibility with internal readers who weren't at the meeting — they see their colleague's concerns reflected, which validates the document's accuracy.

5. **End with a strong recommended next step.** Vague: "We'd love to continue the conversation." Strong: "Based on our discovery findings, we recommend a 60-minute Technical Deep-Dive on March 18 to map the integration architecture between your SAP, Salesforce, and Snowflake environments. This session will enable us to design a tailored proof-of-concept. Can we confirm this date?" The strong version is actionable, time-bound, and moves the deal forward.

> **War Story:** Two SEs submitted discovery summaries after parallel discovery calls with different divisions of the same company. SE #1 submitted a 4-page technical analysis with detailed architecture diagrams, data flow mappings, and a comprehensive requirements matrix. SE #2 submitted a 1-page summary: three sentences of current state, two bullets of quantified pain ($340K annual remediation cost, 3.5 FTE diverted from strategic work), three sentences of proposed approach, and a specific next step with a date. The VP who received both documents read SE #2's document in 90 seconds and forwarded it to the CFO with the note: "This is exactly what we're dealing with." SE #1's document sat unread in the VP's inbox for 2 weeks. Both SEs had done excellent discovery. Only one had written a document designed for how executives actually consume information.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who uses the discovery summary as a showcase for how much they learned. They include every data point, every stakeholder comment, every architectural nuance. The document is thorough, comprehensive, and completely unreadable. It demonstrates the SE's competence — but it doesn't advance the deal because nobody makes it past paragraph three.

**Interview Angle:**
"After a discovery session, what do you deliver to the prospect and your team?"
A strong answer describes a concise, structured document designed for multiple audiences with specific formatting and forward-ability considerations. A weak answer describes "sending meeting notes and a deck."

**Practical Reference: The 1-Page Discovery Summary Template**

```
DISCOVERY SUMMARY — [Company Name]
Date: [Date] | Prepared by: [SE Name]

CURRENT STATE
[3–4 sentences describing the prospect's environment and 
key challenges — in their words]

QUANTIFIED IMPACT
• [Metric 1]: $XXX,XXX annual cost (per [Name], [Date])
• [Metric 2]: XX hours/week of engineering time diverted
• [Metric 3]: [Business risk or delayed strategic initiative]

PROPOSED APPROACH
[2–3 sentences describing your solution in outcome terms, 
not feature terms. Focus on the business result, not the technology.]

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP
[Specific action + proposed date]
"We recommend a [session type] on [date] to [specific objective]. 
This will position us to [next milestone] by [target date]."
```

🟡 **Mid-Level** — The discovery summary is your deal's most important document. Write it like the champion's CFO will read it — because they will.
