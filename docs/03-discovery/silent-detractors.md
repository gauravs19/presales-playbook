#### 3.4.2 Uncovering Silent Detractors

The most dangerous person in a deal isn't the one who argues with you in meetings. It's the one who says nothing in meetings and then argues against you in the internal discussions you'll never see. Silent detractors kill deals because they exercise their influence in the shadows — in hallway conversations, Slack messages, and 1:1s with the economic buyer that happen without your knowledge.

1. **Why detractors stay silent.** They're not silent because they agree with you. They're silent because they've already decided against you and don't see value in debating it publicly. Or they're silent because they don't want to create conflict in front of a vendor. Or they're silent because they're waiting to voice their concerns in the internal decision meeting — where you won't be present and won't be able to respond. All three scenarios are dangerous.

2. **The "go-around" technique.** At the end of every multi-stakeholder meeting, address each person individually: "Sarah, I want to make sure I've addressed your team's concerns. Is there anything specific about security that you'd want us to dive deeper into?" "James, from an infrastructure perspective, did anything come up today that you'd want to explore further?" The go-around gives each person a direct, personal invitation to raise concerns. Silent detractors often break their silence when directly and politely asked — because refusing to answer a direct question is socially more difficult than remaining silent during a group discussion.

3. **Ask the champion who's sceptical.** Champions know who the detractors are — they work with them daily. "Is there anyone on the evaluation team who has reservations about this project, or about working with an external vendor specifically?" Champions will usually share this intelligence, sometimes with relief: "Yeah, our VP of Infrastructure is convinced he can build this internally. He hasn't said it publicly, but he's been vocal about it in our leadership meetings."

4. **Watch for passive resistance signals.** The detractor who doesn't attend scheduled meetings. The detractor who sends a delegate instead of coming themselves. The detractor who submits evaluation criteria that are designed around a competitor's strengths. The detractor who delays their portion of the security review. These are all forms of passive resistance — and they're more corrosive than active opposition because they're harder to address directly.

5. **Convert or neutralise, don't ignore.** You have two options with a silent detractor: convert them by addressing their specific (but unstated) concern, or neutralise them by ensuring the other stakeholders have strong enough conviction to proceed despite the objection. Converting is better: request a 1:1 meeting. "I'd love to spend 30 minutes understanding your team's specific requirements. I want to make sure our solution addresses the infrastructure perspective, not just the data perspective." In the 1:1, the detractor often opens up — because the social dynamics of a 1:1 are different from a group meeting.

> **War Story:** An SE was running a deal that seemed to be going perfectly. Three stakeholders attending every meeting. All questions answered. POC criteria agreed. Then, two days before the POC kickoff, the champion called: "Bad news. Our VP of Architecture vetoed the POC. He thinks we should build this ourselves." The VP had attended one meeting, said nothing, and then killed the deal in a leadership meeting the next day. The SE had noticed the VP's silence but hadn't probed it. After this loss, the SE implemented a rule: if any stakeholder is silent for more than one meeting, request a direct 1:1. The cost of a 30-minute conversation is negligible. The cost of an undetected veto is catastrophic.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who interprets silence as agreement. "Nobody raised any concerns in the meeting, so we must be in good shape." This interpretation is almost always wrong in enterprise sales. Stakeholders who agree are often the most vocal. Stakeholders who disagree are often the most silent. The absence of objection is not the presence of agreement.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you handle stakeholders who are quiet or disengaged during evaluations?"
A strong answer describes proactive techniques (go-around, 1:1 requests, champion intelligence). A weak answer says "I focus on the people who are engaged."

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Silence in enterprise deals is never neutral. It's either agreement or concealed opposition. Always assume the latter until proven otherwise.
