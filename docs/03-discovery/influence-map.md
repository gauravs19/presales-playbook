#### 3.4.4 The Org Chart You Draw vs. The One That Matters

Every large deal requires an org chart. The question is: which org chart? The one HR publishes — where boxes and lines represent formal reporting relationships — or the one that actually governs how decisions are made?

In enterprise organisations, formal authority and actual influence are rarely the same thing. The CTO may sit at the top of the technology org chart but defer technical decisions to a Principal Engineer who's been at the company for 15 years. The VP of Data may own the budget but rely entirely on a Senior Director to make vendor recommendations. The CISO may have formal veto authority but only exercises it when prompted by a Security Architect who secretly runs the InfoSec evaluation.

The org chart you draw in your CRM tells you who reports to whom. The influence map you draw tells you who listens to whom. The second one determines whether your deal closes.

1. **Build the influence map, not the org chart.** For every deal with 4+ stakeholders, map: who influences whom (trust-based relationships, not reporting lines), who has veto authority (formal or informal), who gains or loses from this purchase decision (political interests), and who the economic buyer listens to most (the trusted advisor, not necessarily a direct report). Draw lines of influence, not lines of authority.

2. **Identify the "grey eminence."** In many organisations, there's a person who has no formal authority over the decision but whose opinion is disproportionately influential. They might be a long-tenured architect, a former CTO who's now an IC, or a board advisor who drops into technology conversations. They don't attend vendor meetings. They don't appear in org charts. But when they say "I don't think this is the right solution," the deal dies. Your champion knows who this person is. Ask: "Is there anyone whose technical opinion carries unusual weight with the decision-makers — even if they're not on the evaluation committee?"

3. **Map motivations, not just positions.** For each person on your influence map, understand their personal motivation: are they a builder (wants the best technical solution), a politician (wants the option that advances their career), a protector (wants the safest option with the least risk), or a disruptor (wants to change the status quo)? Your narrative to each person should match their motivation. The builder wants architecture depth. The politician wants to champion a successful project. The protector wants risk mitigation and references. The disruptor wants innovation and competitive advantage.

4. **Track changes in the influence map.** Organisations are dynamic. People get promoted, transferred, or fired. New leaders join with new priorities. Budget authority shifts between departments. Your influence map should be reviewed and updated at every deal milestone. If you built the map at the discovery stage and never updated it, the map you're using during the POC may be fiction.

5. **Share your map with the champion.** When you present your understanding of the decision dynamics to the champion, you validate (or correct) your assumptions and build trust. "Here's how I understand the decision dynamics: the CTO has budget authority, your VP makes the recommendation, and the Principal Architect has informal veto power. Is that accurate?" Champions appreciate this because it shows strategic awareness — and they'll correct you if you're wrong, which is even more valuable.

> **War Story:** An SE drew the standard org chart for a deal: CTO → VP Engineering → Director of Data → Senior Engineers (evaluation team). The deal was progressing well with the Director and the VPs. Two weeks before the expected decision, the SE learned that the company had recently created a "Technology Advisory Board" — three external consultants who reviewed all vendor selections above $500K. This board wasn't on any internal org chart because they were external. The SE had no relationship with any of the three consultants. The advisory board recommended a competitor. The deal was lost. The formal org chart was accurate. The actual decision structure was invisible.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who relies on the CRM org chart and never investigates influence dynamics. They engage the people in the boxes, follow the lines, and assume that decisions flow naturally from the bottom of the chart to the top. In reality, decisions flow through trust networks, political alliances, and shadow governance structures that no CRM has ever captured. The org chart is a legal document. The influence map is a political document. Politics determine enterprise purchases.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you map the decision-making dynamics within a prospect's organisation?"
A strong answer distinguishes between formal authority and informal influence, describes techniques for identifying hidden influencers, and provides an example. A weak answer describes "mapping the org chart."

🟡 **Mid-Level** — The org chart tells you structure. The influence map tells you power. In enterprise sales, power closes deals.
