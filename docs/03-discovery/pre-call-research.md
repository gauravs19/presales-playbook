#### 3.1.1 Pre-Call LinkedIn & Earnings Transcript Recon

The SE who walks into a discovery call without researching their prospect is gambling with the most precious resource in presales: first impression credibility. The first 5 minutes of a discovery call determine whether the prospect mentally categorises you as "vendor who will waste my time" or "professional who has done their homework." Research is the difference.

And the research doesn't need to take long. Fifteen minutes of structured recon produces disproportionate ROI.

1. **LinkedIn: the people, not the company.** Start with the individuals who will be on the call, not the company page. For each person, note: their tenure (new in role = different dynamic than 10-year veteran), their career trajectory (came from a competitor's customer? — they know the space), their recent activity (liked a post about cloud migration? — that's a signal), and mutual connections (your SE peer worked at their previous company? — warm introduction possibility). The specific insight you're looking for: what does this person care about professionally right now?

2. **Earnings transcripts: the company's actual priorities.** For publicly traded companies, the most recent quarterly earnings call transcript is a goldmine. Search for mentions of: technology investments ("We're investing $40M in digital transformation this year"), operational challenges ("Our legacy systems are creating reconciliation delays"), and strategic initiatives ("We plan to expand into three new European markets by Q4"). These aren't vague signals — they're public commitments by the CEO to shareholders. When you reference them in discovery, you're speaking the language of their C-suite.

3. **Annual reports and 10-K filings.** For deep enterprise deals, skim the risk factors section of the 10-K. This section lists the company's self-identified vulnerabilities — regulatory risks, technology debt, competitive threats. If your product addresses one of these risk factors, you have a ready-made business case: "Your 10-K identifies data governance as a material risk. Our platform directly addresses the auditability and lineage requirements that would mitigate that risk."

4. **Recent news and press releases.** A 2-minute Google News search reveals: recent acquisitions (integration complexity incoming), leadership changes (new CTO = new vendor evaluations), product launches (scaling challenges), and regulatory actions (compliance urgency). Each of these is a potential discovery entry point. "I noticed your company recently acquired [Company X]. Integration projects like that often surface data pipeline complexity that wasn't visible before the acquisition. Is that something your team is experiencing?"

5. **Their technology stack.** Use tools like BuiltWith, Wappalyzer, or simply browse their job postings to identify their current technology stack. If they're hiring Snowflake engineers, they're investing in cloud data. If they're posting for Kubernetes engineers, they're containerising. If they're hiring SIEM analysts, security is top of mind. Job postings are a live roadmap of a company's technical priorities.

> **War Story:** An SE was preparing for a discovery call with the VP of Data Engineering at a logistics company. Her 15-minute recon uncovered: the VP had been in role for 4 months (new hire = looking to make an impact), the company's latest earnings call mentioned "operational efficiency improvements through data modernisation," and their job postings showed 6 open positions for Apache Kafka engineers (real-time streaming is a priority). She opened the call: "Congratulations on the new role — I know the first few months are about understanding the landscape. I noticed your team is investing heavily in streaming infrastructure. We work with several logistics companies on real-time pipeline architectures. I'd love to understand what's driving that investment on your side." The VP's response: "You're the first vendor who didn't open with a product pitch. Let's talk." That single opening — informed by 15 minutes of research — set the tone for a deal that closed at $480K.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who opens every discovery call with: "So, tell me about your company." This question broadcasts: "I did zero research." The prospect thinks: "I'm about to waste 30 minutes explaining my business to someone who should have spent 10 minutes on Google." First impression: damaged. Trust gap: widened. The demo jockey reputation: reinforced.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you prepare for a first meeting with a new prospect?"
A strong answer describes a specific research routine (LinkedIn, earnings, news, tech stack) with an example of how research informed the conversation. A weak answer says "I review the CRM notes and the company website."

**Practical Reference: The 15-Minute Pre-Call Recon Checklist**

| Source | Time | What to Look For | Where to Use It |
|--------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| LinkedIn (people) | 5 min | Tenure, trajectory, recent activity, mutual connections | Personalised opening, rapport building |
| Earnings transcript / 10-K | 5 min | Technology investments, operational challenges, strategic priorities | Hypothesis formation, pain framing |
| News + press releases | 3 min | Acquisitions, leadership changes, regulatory actions | Discovery entry points |
| Job postings / tech stack | 2 min | Technology investments, team scaling, infrastructure priorities | Technical discovery anchoring |

🟢 **Entry-Level** — This checklist is non-negotiable. Do it before every first meeting. No exceptions.
