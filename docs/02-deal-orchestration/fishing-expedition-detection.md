#### 2.1.3 Recognising a Fishing Expedition vs. a Real Opportunity

Not every prospect who agrees to a meeting wants to buy something. Some are collecting competitive intelligence for a vendor they've already chosen. Some are building a business case by gathering vendor proposals they'll never act on. Some are satisfying a procurement requirement to "evaluate three vendors" when their preferred supplier was selected months ago. These are fishing expeditions — and they will consume your time, your energy, and your optimism if you can't identify them early.

1. **Signal: the prospect won't share their current environment.** A real buyer has no reason to hide their architecture, their pain points, or their existing tools. A fishing expedition prospect deflects: "We'd rather not get into specifics right now — just show us what you can do." This is a red flag because it means one of two things: they don't trust you enough to share (in which case discovery needs to happen before a demo), or they don't want you to tailor your pitch because they're not actually comparing — they're just collecting.

2. **Signal: the evaluation criteria are pre-written and non-negotiable.** Real evaluations develop criteria collaboratively — the prospect describes their needs, and both sides shape the evaluation approach. Fishing expedition criteria arrive as a completed spreadsheet with 200 line items, many of which read like they were copied from a competitor's marketing material. If the criteria feel designed for someone else to win, they probably were.

3. **Signal: no access to the decision-maker.** If you're presenting to a team of analysts who "will take the findings to leadership," you're not in a deal — you're in a research project. Real deals involve decision-makers, or at minimum champions who have a direct line to the decision-maker and a mandate to recommend. Research projects involve people who are compiling options for someone else who may or may not act on them.

4. **Signal: the timeline is elastic or non-existent.** "We're not in a rush." "We want to take our time and do this right." "There's no hard deadline." These phrases are not signs of careful evaluation. They're signs that there's no compelling event driving the decision. Without a forcing function — a contract expiry, a regulatory deadline, a board initiative — deals in motion tend to stay in motion forever, which means they stay in your pipeline forever, consuming bandwidth without producing revenue.

5. **The validation test:** Tell the prospect something mildly unfavourable about your product. "Our platform doesn't support on-premise deployment — we're cloud-only." Watch their reaction. A real buyer will engage: "That's a concern — our security team has strong feelings about data residency." A fishing expedition prospect will note it politely and move on. Why? Because they don't actually care about your limitations — they're not building a real decision model. They're filling a spreadsheet.

> **War Story:** An SE spent 3 weeks preparing a custom demo, a solution architecture, and a detailed proposal for a prospect that looked perfect: Fortune 500, strong technical requirements, large potential deal size. When the SE sent the proposal, the prospect went dark. No response for 10 days. When the champion finally replied, she said: "Really appreciate the thorough work. We've decided to go with [incumbent vendor] — they offered a contract extension at a significant discount." The SE reviewed the signals retrospectively: the prospect had never shared their current architecture, the evaluation criteria arrived pre-written, and the decision-maker never attended a single meeting. Every signal of a fishing expedition was there. The SE had ignored them because the deal *looked* too good to walk away from.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who can't distinguish between a cautious buyer (who is genuinely thorough but slow) and a fishing expedition (who is collecting information with no intent to act). The difference: cautious buyers ask hard questions because they need to build conviction. Fishing expedition prospects ask easy questions because they just need to check a box. If every question feels like it came from a template rather than from genuine curiosity, you're probably on a fishing expedition.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you distinguish a real opportunity from a fishing expedition?"
A strong answer identifies specific signals (lack of access, pre-written criteria, elastic timeline) and describes a validation technique they use. A weak answer says "you can usually tell from the vibe."

**Practical Reference: The Fishing Expedition Scorecard**

| Signal | Real Opportunity | Fishing Expedition |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Prospect shares current architecture? | Yes, proactively | Deflects or gives minimal info |
| Evaluation criteria | Developed collaboratively | Arrived pre-written, non-negotiable |
| Decision-maker access | Available or on the calendar | "We'll take findings to leadership" |
| Timeline | Hard deadline with business driver | "No rush" / elastic |
| Questions asked | Specific, probing, sometimes hard | Generic, template-like, polite |
| Reaction to limitations | Engages, tests implications | Notes politely, moves on |

**If 4+ signals indicate "Fishing Expedition," reduce your investment to minimal effort and communicate the risk to your AE.**

🟡 **Mid-Level** — The best SEs don't avoid fishing expeditions — they identify them in the first 15 minutes and redirect their energy to real opportunities.
