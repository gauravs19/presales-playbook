#### 2.4.3 Saying No to Low-Priority Requests

The ability to say no is the highest-leverage time management skill in presales. It's also the hardest — because the SE role is culturally wired to say yes. The AE asks for a demo: yes. The SDR asks for a quick technical call: yes. Product marketing asks for a customer reference story: yes. The SE manager asks you to mentor a new hire: yes. Each individual "yes" is reasonable. Collectively, they consume 30–40% of your week with work that doesn't move your top deals forward.

1. **Distinguish between urgent and important.** Most low-priority requests feel urgent because someone is asking you directly and they need an answer now. But urgent ≠ important. A Tier 3 deal demo is urgent (the AE wants it scheduled this week). A Tier 1 deal executive briefing is important (it determines whether your biggest deal advances). If you say yes to every urgent request, you'll never have time for the important ones. The solution isn't to be unhelpful — it's to triage.

2. **The "Yes, and here's the trade-off" technique.** Never respond to a request with a flat no. Respond with: "Yes, I can do that. If I do, here's what I'll need to deprioritise: [Tier 1 deal activity]. Are you comfortable with that trade-off?" This puts the decision back on the requestor. If the AE says "yes, please deprioritise the Tier 1 deal for my Tier 3 request," escalate to your SE manager — because that's a portfolio-level decision, not an individual request.

3. **Batch low-priority requests.** Some requests don't need customised attention — they need a standard response. Build a library of reusable assets: a standard demo recording, a pre-written architecture overview, a FAQ document for common technical questions. When a low-priority request comes in, check whether a reusable asset addresses it before committing custom time.

4. **Set expectations proactively.** At the start of each week, communicate your priorities to AE partners: "This week, my priority deals are [A] and [B]. I've blocked time for their executive briefing and POC prep. I can attend the [C] meeting on Thursday if it's 30 minutes or less, but I won't be doing custom preparation. If something changes on [C] that makes it more urgent, let me know and we'll re-tier." Proactive communication prevents reactive conflict.

5. **Protect your calendar architecturally.** Block 2–3 hours per day for Tier 1 deal work. Make these blocks visible on your calendar. When someone tries to schedule over them, point to the block: "I have that time reserved for [Tier 1 deal] preparation. Can we do 3 PM instead?" Calendar blocks are the physical manifestation of your tiering decisions. Without them, your time allocation is a wish, not a plan.

> **War Story:** An SE tracked his time for 2 weeks and discovered he was spending 12 hours per week on requests that didn't relate to his top 3 deals: ad-hoc demos for SDR-sourced leads, internal product feedback sessions, team meeting preparation, and "quick" technical calls that always ran 45 minutes. He implemented three changes: he redirected SDR demo requests to a pre-recorded demo library, he declined non-essential internal meetings, and he blocked 2 hours each morning for Tier 1 deal work. The result: he reclaimed 8 hours per week — essentially a full day — that he redirected to his Tier 1 deals. His technical win rate climbed from 35% to 48% that quarter. He didn't work more. He said no more.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who says yes to everything because they're afraid of being perceived as unhelpful or not a "team player." They attend every meeting, accept every request, and burn out by mid-quarter. Their Tier 1 deals suffer because they never have deep work time. Their AEs are dissatisfied because the custom demo they received was rushed. Their manager is concerned because their win rate is dropping. The irony: saying yes to everything makes everyone less satisfied, not more.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you handle situations where you have more requests than bandwidth?"
A strong answer describes a triage system (tiering, trade-off communication, reusable assets). A weak answer says "I work extra hours" or "I try to fit everything in."

**Practical Reference: The Request Triage Flowchart**

```
New request received
  ├── Does it serve a Tier 1 or Tier 2 deal?
  │     ├── Yes → Accept and schedule
  │     └── No → Continue evaluation
  │
  ├── Can a reusable asset address it?
  │     ├── Yes → Send the asset, no custom work
  │     └── No → Continue evaluation
  │
  ├── Will saying yes require deprioritising a Tier 1 activity?
  │     ├── Yes → Communicate trade-off to requestor
  │     └── No → Accept if time permits
  │
  └── Can it wait until next week?
        ├── Yes → Defer with clear timeline
        └── No → Escalate to SE manager for prioritisation
```

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Saying no is an investment in your yes. Every no to a low-priority request is a yes to your highest-value work.
