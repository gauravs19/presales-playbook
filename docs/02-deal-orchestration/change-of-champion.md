#### 2.3.3 Surviving the Change of Champion Mid-Deal

Your champion just left the company. Or got promoted to a different division. Or went on extended leave. Or got fired. Whatever the reason, the person who was carrying your deal internally — the person who believed in your solution, attended every meeting, sold to their leadership, and protected you from detractors — is gone.

This is the single most devastating event in enterprise presales. And it happens on roughly 15–20% of deals that run longer than 6 months.

1. **The first 48 hours are critical.** When you learn that your champion is gone, your immediate action is not to panic — it's to identify who inherits their initiatives. Ask the departing champion (if accessible): "Who on your team will be taking the lead on the projects you were driving?" Ask your AE: "Do we have any other contacts in the account who know about our evaluation?" Ask LinkedIn: search the company for new hires or role changes that might indicate a successor. The faster you identify the new point of contact, the less time the deal spends in vacuum.

2. **The new champion knows nothing about your deal.** Even if the replacement was tangentially aware of the evaluation, they don't have the context that your original champion had. They haven't seen the discovery findings. They haven't experienced the demo. They haven't built conviction in your solution. You're starting the relationship at zero trust and zero context. Accept this. Don't make the mistake of assuming "they must have been briefed." They weren't.

3. **Offer a brief "reset" session.** Contact the new person with a concise message: "I understand you're taking over the [project name] initiative. We've been working with [previous champion] on a technical evaluation. Rather than assume you have all the context, I'd like to offer a 30-minute reset session where I can walk you through where we are, what we've validated, and what the remaining steps look like. No sales pitch — just a handover so you can make an informed decision about how to proceed." This positions you as helpful, not desperate. It also gives you the opportunity to re-establish technical trust with the new stakeholder.

4. **The new champion may not share the old champion's priorities.** Your original champion cared about data pipeline performance. The new person might care about security compliance. Your original champion was an advocate for your solution. The new person might be neutral — or might already have a preferred competitor. Don't assume alignment. Run a mini-discovery with the new champion to understand their priorities, concerns, and biases. You may need to reposition your entire solution narrative.

5. **This is why you multi-thread.** (See Section 2.2.3.) If you have 3+ active threads in the account, a champion departure is a setback, not a death sentence. Your executive sponsor is still there. Your technical evaluator contact is still there. Your security relationship is still there. The deal survives because it was built on multiple relationships, not a single dependency. If you're single-threaded when the champion leaves, you've just learned the most expensive lesson in presales.

> **War Story:** An SE was 3 weeks from a technical win at a major logistics company. The champion — a VP of Data Engineering — accepted a role at a different company. The SE's first reaction was panic. His second reaction was process. He checked his thread map: he had a technical evaluator (the VP's direct report) and a security contact. He called the technical evaluator: "I know [champion] has moved on. We're close to completing the evaluation. Would you be comfortable leading the final steps internally, or would you prefer me to connect with [champion's replacement]?" The evaluator — who had been deeply involved in the POC — said, "I can carry this forward. The results speak for themselves." The deal closed 5 weeks later, delayed by 2 weeks but not destroyed. The evaluator became the new champion because the SE had invested in that relationship throughout the deal, not just in the original champion.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who treats the champion departure as the deal's death and stops investing effort. "Without [champion], this deal is dead." Maybe. But deals have been won after champion departures when the SE was proactive about rebuilding. The SE who gives up immediately loses 100% of deals after champion departures. The SE who runs the recovery playbook saves 30–40% of them. 30–40% of a deal that was going to die is significant revenue recovered.

**Interview Angle:**
"Has a champion ever left a deal mid-cycle? How did you handle it?"
A strong answer describes the specific deal, the immediate actions taken, the recovery strategy, and the outcome.  A weak answer says "it was devastating" without describing a structured response.

**Practical Reference: The Champion Departure Recovery Playbook**

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Day 1 | Identify successor or interim contact through champion, AE, or LinkedIn |
| Day 1–2 | Brief your AE and SE manager; assess deal impact |
| Day 2–3 | Send "reset session" offer to new contact |
| Week 1 | Conduct reset session; run mini-discovery on new priorities |
| Week 1–2 | Re-establish technical narrative based on new champion's concerns |
| Week 2+ | Resume proof path, adjusted for new stakeholder dynamics |

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Champion departures test your multi-threading discipline, your stakeholder mapping, and your emotional resilience. Prepare for them before they happen — because they will.
