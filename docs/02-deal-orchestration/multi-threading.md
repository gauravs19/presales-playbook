#### 2.2.3 Multi-Threading Before the Competition Does

Single-threaded deals die. It's not a risk — it's a statistical certainty. If your entire deal depends on one relationship (your champion), one champion departure, one organisational restructure, or one budget reallocation will kill it instantly. Multi-threading — building relationships with multiple stakeholders across different levels and functions — is the deal insurance policy that most SEs buy too late.

1. **Multi-thread by level.** Your champion is typically a mid-level technical evaluator. They have influence but not authority. You also need: someone at the executive level who owns the budget decision, someone at the peer level who will validate the champion's recommendation, and someone at the implementation level who will confirm that your solution is deployable. Four threads across three levels transforms a single point of failure into a resilient deal structure.

2. **Multi-thread by function.** Technical evaluators only see the technical picture. You also need relationships with: the business owner who will measure ROI (they care about outcomes, not architecture), the security team who will validate compliance (they can veto the deal at the 11th hour), and the procurement contact who will manage the contract (they control the timeline from technical win to signature). Each function has different concerns. Address them in parallel, not sequentially.

3. **Use meetings to introduce new threads naturally.** The best way to multi-thread: at the end of every meeting, ask "Would it be valuable to include [role] in our next conversation? I want to make sure we're addressing [their concern] early so it doesn't become a blocker downstream." This isn't pushy — it's helpful. You're preventing future delays by including stakeholders now rather than surprising them later. Most champions will agree because they also want to avoid late-stage blockers.

4. **Your competitor is multi-threading right now.** If you're not building relationships with the economic buyer, security team, and implementation lead, your competitor is. And when the decision comes down to two technically equivalent solutions, the vendor with broader stakeholder relationships wins — because more people in the room know them, trust them, and are invested in their success. Multi-threading is not optional. It's competitive survival.

5. **Map your threads visually.** Create a simple stakeholder map for every deal with 3+ stakeholders. For each person, note: their name, their role, their stance (champion / neutral / sceptic / blocker), your last interaction, and their primary concern. Review this map weekly. If you have a gap (no executive thread, no security thread), close it this week — not next month.

> **War Story:** An SE had a strong champion — a Director of Engineering who loved the product. The POC was successful. The technical evaluation was positive. The deal was forecasted to close in Q2. In week 3 of Q2, the Director of Engineering left the company for a competitor. The deal had zero other threads. The new Director brought in their own preferred vendor. The deal, worth $650K, was dead within a week. The SE had spent 4 months on the evaluation. If they'd built even one additional thread — an executive sponsor, a peer-level advocate — the deal would have survived the champion departure. After this loss, the SE adopted a strict rule: no deal stays single-threaded past the second meeting.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who relies entirely on the champion for all communication. The champion schedules meetings. The champion relays information to the executive team. The champion manages internal procurement. The SE never speaks directly to anyone else. This is comfortable — single-threaded deals are easier to manage — but it's fragile. One champion departure, one champion vacation, one champion getting pulled onto another project, and the deal goes dark with no backup relationships.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you build relationships beyond your primary champion in a deal?"
A strong answer describes deliberate multi-threading tactics (meeting introductions, parallel tracks for security/procurement, executive sponsor cultivation). A weak answer relies entirely on the champion for all stakeholder access.

**Practical Reference: The Stakeholder Thread Map**

| Name | Title | Function | Stance | Last Contact | Primary Concern | Next Action |
|------|-------|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| | | Technical | Champion | | | |
| | | Executive | | | | |
| | | Security | | | | |
| | | Procurement | | | | |
| | | Implementation | | | | |

**Rule: no deal should have fewer than 3 active threads by the time you enter POC stage.** If you're single-threaded entering a POC, your POC result is meaningless — there's no one to carry it to the decision.

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Multi-threading is effort. Single-threading is risk. In enterprise sales, effort is recoverable. Lost deals are not.
