#### 2.4.2 The Weekly SE Deal Review

Most SE teams have a weekly pipeline review — but it's usually an AE-led meeting where SEs passively report on deal status. The Weekly SE Deal Review is different. It's an SE-led exercise where you audit your own portfolio with the discipline of a portfolio manager reviewing fund allocation.

This isn't about updating a spreadsheet. It's about making three decisions every Monday: what to invest more in, what to invest less in, and what to kill.

1. **Block 30 minutes every Monday morning.** Non-negotiable. Before you open email. Before you accept meeting requests. Before you start preparing for the week's calls. This 30-minute block is the most strategically valuable half-hour in your week. It's where you shift from reactive ("what meetings do I have today?") to proactive ("what deals need my attention this week, and what can I deprioritise?").

2. **Review each deal against four questions:**
   - **What changed since last week?** New stakeholder identified? Budget confirmed? Champion went dark? Competitor surfaced? If nothing changed, the deal is stalling — and stalling is dying in slow motion.
   - **What is the #1 risk to this deal right now?** Not the general risk — the specific, immediate risk. "No access to economic buyer" is more actionable than "deal might not close."
   - **What is the single most important action I can take this week?** Not a list of 5 tasks. One task. The one that moves the deal forward the most. "Send the executive architecture summary to the CTO" or "Run the POC results call with the security team."
   - **Should this deal's tier change?** Based on what's changed, does this deal deserve more or less of your time than it got last week?

3. **Flag stalled deals immediately.** If a deal has had "no change" for 2 consecutive weeks, it's stalling. Run the 3-touch requalification sequence (Section 2.2.2). If it doesn't respond, demote it to Tier 3 or close it. The most expensive deals in your portfolio are the ones that haven't moved in 3 weeks but haven't been officially killed.

4. **Share your review with your AE partners.** After your Monday audit, send a brief message to each AE: "Here's my status on our shared deals. [Deal A]: on track, next step is POC kickoff Wed. [Deal B]: stalling — no response from champion in 10 days. Can you try re-engaging? [Deal C]: strong trajectory, I'm prioritising this as Tier 1 this week." This 2-minute message prevents miscommunication and shows the AE that you're managing their deals with intentionality.

5. **Track trends, not just snapshots.** After 4 weeks of Monday reviews, patterns emerge: "My deals consistently stall after discovery but before demo — I might not be creating enough urgency in my discovery close." "I'm spending 40% of my time on Tier 3 deals that never progress — I need to be more aggressive about qualification." These patterns are invisible in a single review but obvious across a month of data.

> **War Story:** An SE started the Monday review ritual and within 3 weeks discovered something troubling: 4 of his 10 deals had been in the same stage for 3+ weeks. Not because they were complex — because nobody on either side (SE or AE) had taken the next step. No follow-up sent. No meeting scheduled. No action taken. They were "active" in the CRM but dead in reality. He killed 2 and reactivated 2 with direct outreach. His pipeline went from 10 deals at 30% average accuracy to 8 deals at 55% accuracy. His manager was initially concerned about the pipeline shrinkage. By quarter end, the 8 accurate deals produced more revenue than the 10 stale ones would have.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who "doesn't have time" for the Monday review. They jump straight into Monday's meetings, react to whatever the AE asks for, and spend the week in firefighting mode. By Friday, they can't remember which deals they advanced and which ones they neglected. They're perpetually reactive — doing what feels urgent instead of what is important. The 30-minute Monday review is the antidote to reactive presales.

**Interview Angle:**
"Walk me through your weekly routine for managing your deal portfolio."
A strong answer describes a structured review cadence with specific questions, tiering decisions, and AE communication. A weak answer describes "checking CRM and responding to emails."

**Time to complete: 30 minutes. Impact on your quarter: disproportionate.**

🟡 **Mid-Level** — The Monday review is the difference between managing a portfolio and being managed by a calendar. Do it religiously.
