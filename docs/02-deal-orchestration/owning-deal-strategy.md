#### 2.2.1 When the AE's Strategy Is Wrong

You've been briefed on a deal. The AE's strategy: demo next week, push for POC commitment, compress to close by end of quarter. You've reviewed the opportunity: the prospect has no confirmed budget, the champion is an individual contributor with no executive sponsor, and the competitor is the incumbent with a contract that doesn't expire for 9 months. The AE's strategy isn't wrong because they're bad at their job. It's wrong because it doesn't match the deal reality you can see from the technical side.

Your job isn't to execute a strategy you know will fail. Your job is to propose a better one.

1. **Start with shared facts, not your opinion.** Don't say "I think your strategy is wrong." Say: "I've reviewed the deal and I want to share some data points. The prospect's current contract with [Incumbent] runs through Q3. Their champion is an IC without executive sponsorship. Discovery hasn't uncovered quantified pain yet. Given these factors, I'm concerned that pushing for a POC commitment next week will feel premature." Facts first. Opinions second. This framing makes it a collaborative problem-solving conversation, not a confrontation.

2. **Propose an alternative with the same goal.** The AE wants to accelerate the deal? Good — so do you. But acceleration through the wrong motion produces the opposite result. Your alternative: "Instead of a demo next week, I'd recommend a 45-minute Executive Discovery session where we map their current architecture pain and quantify the cost of delay. That gives us the ammunition to build an executive champion — which is what we need to overcome the incumbent relationship. Then we can position the demo as a 'solution to the specific problems we identified' rather than a generic product overview." Same goal (accelerate). Better path.

3. **Frame your alternative in terms the AE values.** AEs think in pipeline stage progression, revenue impact, and forecast accuracy. Translate your technical perspective into their language: "If we demo before discovery, we'll likely hear 'thanks, we'll get back to you' — which moves the deal backward, not forward. If we run discovery first, we can produce a pain-quantification document that the champion can take to their VP. That's what moves this from Stage 2 to Stage 3." You're not speaking SE language. You're speaking deal language.

4. **Accept that you may be overruled.** You've presented your case. The AE disagrees. Their manager backs them. You've lost the argument. Execute the strategy you disagreed with — but execute it well. Half-hearted execution of someone else's strategy is worse than fully committed execution of a suboptimal strategy. And document your recommendation so that when the post-mortem happens (and it will), your perspective is on record.

5. **Track the outcome.** If your alternative was right, the deal will stall or lose against the AE's approach. If the AE's approach was right, the deal will progress. Either way, the outcome becomes data for your next strategic disagreement. SEs who are right 70%+ of the time earn significant strategic influence. SEs who are right 50% of the time learn from their misses. SEs who never disagree never find out whether they would have been right.

> **War Story:** An AE wanted to respond to a large RFP from a healthcare company. The SE reviewed the RFP requirements and identified that 25% of the technical criteria were specific to a competitor — language, feature names, and use cases that aligned perfectly with the incumbent. The SE's assessment: "This RFP was ghostwritten by [Competitor]. We're column fodder — they need three vendor responses, and we're vendor #3." The AE insisted they respond: "It's a $2M opportunity; we can't not bid." The SE proposed a compromise: "Let's respond, but invest minimal effort — standard responses, no custom demo, no solution architecture. If they come back with genuine interest after our response, I'll invest fully. If they don't, we've spent 8 hours instead of 80." They submitted a standard response. The prospect selected the incumbent without requesting a demo from any competitor. The SE's 8-hour investment was the right call. A full response would have consumed two weeks.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who silently disagrees with the AE's strategy and then executes it passively. They know the demo is premature, so they deliver a mediocre one. They know the POC is scoped incorrectly, so they run it at 50% effort. They're not being intentionally sabotaging — they're just not invested in a strategy they don't believe in. The result is equally destructive: the deal fails, and the post-mortem blames the SE's execution rather than the strategy. If you disagree, say so. If you're overruled, execute fully. There is no middle ground.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a time you disagreed with your AE's deal strategy. What did you do?"
A strong answer describes a specific disagreement, the evidence used, the alternative proposed, and the willingness to commit fully regardless of the outcome. A weak answer describes compliance without contribution.

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Owning deal strategy isn't overstepping. It's the Senior SE's obligation. If you can see the deal is heading for a cliff and you stay silent, the wreck is partly your responsibility.
