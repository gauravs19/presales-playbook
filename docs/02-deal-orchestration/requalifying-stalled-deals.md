#### 2.2.2 Requalifying Stalled Deals

Every SE has them: deals that were "90-day closes" eight months ago. The prospect loved the demo. The champion was enthusiastic. The technical evaluation went well. And then... nothing. No response to your follow-up. No progress on procurement. No next steps. The deal sits in the pipeline like a phantom — technically alive, practically dead.

Stalled deals are the most expensive items in your portfolio because they consume mindshare without producing revenue. Requalifying them is the discipline of determining whether a stalled deal is dormant (temporarily paused, with a real path back to life) or dead (no longer a viable opportunity, masquerading as pipeline).

1. **The 3-touch test.** Before investing any additional effort, send three escalating communications over 10 business days. Touch 1: a value-add message ("I came across a case study from [similar company] that maps to the architecture challenges you raised — thought it might be useful"). Touch 2: a direct status inquiry ("We haven't connected in a few weeks — has anything changed on your end with the timeline?"). Touch 3: a polite ultimatum ("I want to respect your team's time. If the project is no longer active, I'm happy to close this out and reconnect when timing is better. If it is active, I'd love to schedule 30 minutes to align on next steps"). If all three go unanswered, the deal is dead. Remove it from your active portfolio.

2. **Diagnose why it stalled.** Stalled deals fall into five categories:

| Stall Type | Root Cause | Requalification Path |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Budget freeze | Funding was redirected or cut | Re-engage when the next budget cycle opens |
| Champion departure | Your internal advocate left the company or changed roles | Identify a new champion or deprioritise |
| Priority shift | A bigger project consumed the team's attention | Wait it out; re-engage when their priority project completes |
| Competitive loss | They chose a competitor but didn't tell you | Ask directly — "Did you go with another solution?" |
| Decision paralysis | Too many stakeholders, no consensus | Propose a smaller scope to reduce the decision burden |

3. **Re-engage with new value, not old context.** The worst requalification approach: "Just following up on our conversation from March." This tells the prospect you have nothing new to offer. The best requalification approach: "Since we last spoke, we've released [relevant feature/capability]. I also noticed your company announced [relevant news — acquisition, expansion, regulatory change]. Both might change the calculus on the project you were evaluating. Worth a 15-minute call?" New value combined with business-relevant awareness signals that you've been paying attention — not just waiting.

4. **Set a kill date for every stalled deal.** If a deal has been stalled for 6 months with no response to your 3-touch sequence, it's dead. Mark it as closed-lost in the CRM, log the reason, and move on. The emotional resistance to closing stalled deals is strong — "but what if they come back?" — and it's the reason sales pipelines are routinely inflated by 30–40%. Dead deals don't come back because you kept them in the pipeline. They come back because the prospect's business situation changes — and when it does, they'll reach out regardless of your CRM status.

5. **Use stalled deals as a learning mechanism.** Every stall has a lesson. If multiple deals stall after the POC phase, your POC process may not be creating enough urgency. If deals stall after discovery, your discovery may not be surfacing deep enough pain. If deals stall after the champion engagement, your champion coaching may be insufficient. Track stall patterns quarterly and adjust your process accordingly.

> **War Story:** An SE had 7 stalled deals in his pipeline totalling $4.2M. His manager required him to run the 3-touch sequence on all 7 within 2 weeks. Results: 3 deals responded — 2 reactivated with revised timelines, 1 admitted they'd chosen a competitor 4 months ago. 4 deals didn't respond to any touch. The SE closed all 4 as lost. His pipeline dropped from $8M to $4.6M — but his pipeline accuracy went from 40% to 75%. The VP of Sales, who initially worried about the pipeline reduction, later cited it as the most valuable exercise of the quarter: "I'd rather have $4.6M of real pipeline than $8M of fiction."

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who keeps stalled deals alive because they're afraid their pipeline will look thin. They don't run the 3-touch sequence because they don't want to hear "we've gone with someone else." They report stalled deals as "in progress" in pipeline reviews because it's less uncomfortable than admitting the deal is dead. The result: inflated pipeline, inaccurate forecasts, and SE bandwidth allocated to phantom deals instead of real ones.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you handle deals that go dark or stall after initial engagement?"
A strong answer describes a systematic requalification process (escalating touches, root cause diagnosis, kill date discipline). A weak answer says "I keep following up" without a defined endpoint.

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Pipeline hygiene isn't glamorous. It's necessary. The SE who can cleanly separate dormant from dead deals has the most accurate forecast on the team — and the most productive use of their time.
