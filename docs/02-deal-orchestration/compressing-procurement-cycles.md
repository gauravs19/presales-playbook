#### 2.3.1 Compressing 18-Month Procurement Cycles

Enterprise procurement is where deals go to die slowly. You've won the technical evaluation. The champion is enthusiastic. The executive sponsor has approved the budget. And then procurement says, "We need to run our standard review. It usually takes 12–18 months." Your heart sinks. Your AE panics. Your forecast moves from Q2 to "TBD."

The truth about long procurement cycles: they're not fixed timelines. They're bureaucratic processes with expandable and compressible sections. The SE who understands procurement mechanics — not just the technical evaluation — can compress these cycles by 30–50%.

1. **Map the procurement process in week 1, not week 20.** Most SEs never ask about procurement until they've already won the technical evaluation. By then, they've invested 3–4 months of effort. Ask early: "Walk me through what happens after you decide you want to move forward. What steps does your procurement team require?" The answer reveals the roadblocks: security questionnaire, legal review, data processing agreement, vendor risk assessment, executive committee approval. Each of these has a timeline. Your job is to discover these timelines early enough to run them in parallel with your evaluation — not in sequence after it.

2. **Pre-fill security questionnaires before they're requested.** Most SEs wait for the prospect's security team to send their questionnaire. Then they scramble to fill it out — a process that takes 1–3 weeks internally because it requires input from your security, legal, and engineering teams. Instead: at the start of every deal with an enterprise prospect, send your pre-filled security questionnaire, SOC 2 report, and data processing agreement proactively. "Here's our standard security documentation. We find this accelerates the process by 4–6 weeks." The prospect's security team now has what they need before they ask for it.

3. **Run parallel tracks, not sequential ones.** In most procurement cycles, the sequence is: technical evaluation → security review → legal review → executive approval → contract negotiation. Each phase waits for the previous to complete. Compress by running tracks 2 and 3 in parallel with track 1. While you're running your POC (technical evaluation), the security team should already be reviewing your documentation. While the security team is reviewing, legal should already have your standard terms. This requires proactive relationship-building with the prospect's security and legal teams — not waiting for the champion to manage it.

4. **Create a mutual action plan (MAP).** A mutual action plan is a shared document between you and the prospect that lists every remaining step, who owns it, and the target date. This sounds obvious but is rarely done. The MAP makes the procurement timeline visible to everyone — including the prospect's internal teams, who often don't realise how many sequential dependencies they've created. "Here's our mutual action plan. As you can see, if the security review starts after the POC completes (week 8), rather than in parallel with it (week 3), the timeline extends by 6 weeks. Would your security team be open to starting their review now?"

5. **Use the champion's authority to escalate.** Procurement delays are often caused by low-priority queues — your contract is sitting in a legal queue behind 40 other contracts. Your champion can escalate internally: "This project has VP sponsorship and a Q2 deadline. Can we move the vendor risk assessment to priority review?" The SE's job is to arm the champion with the justification for escalation: "Based on the timeline we mapped, the procurement process will push us past your Q2 deadline unless we can accelerate the security review. Would your VP be willing to flag this as a priority?"

> **War Story:** An SE was working a deal at a major UK bank. The bank's standard procurement process was 18 months. The SE asked the champion to map the full process in week 2. It turned out that 8 of the 18 months were sequential waiting: security waiting for technical approval, legal waiting for security approval, vendor risk waiting for legal approval. The SE proposed running all three in parallel: he sent the security documentation to the bank's InfoSec team in week 3 (while the POC was still running), sent standard contract terms to legal in week 5, and submitted the vendor risk assessment package in week 6. The result: the procurement process that "usually takes 18 months" was completed in 7 months. Not by changing the process — but by parallelising it.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who views procurement as "someone else's problem" — the AE's, the champion's, or just the inevitable cost of enterprise sales. They invest 4 months in a flawless technical evaluation and then watch the deal die in a 12-month procurement queue that they never mapped, never anticipated, and never attempted to compress. The technical win is meaningless if the contract doesn't get signed.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you handle long procurement cycles in enterprise deals?"
A strong answer describes proactive procurement mapping, parallel tracking, pre-filled security documentation, and mutual action plans. A weak answer says "you just have to be patient with enterprise procurement."

**Practical Reference: The Procurement Compression Checklist**

| Action | Timing | Owner |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Map full procurement process with champion | Week 1–2 | SE + Champion |
| Send pre-filled security docs (SOC 2, DPA, security questionnaire) | Week 2–3 | SE |
| Share standard commercial terms with legal | Week 3–4 | AE + SE |
| Submit vendor risk assessment package | Week 4–5 | SE |
| Create mutual action plan (MAP) | Week 3 | SE + AE + Champion |
| Identify bottleneck steps and request prioritisation | Ongoing | Champion (armed by SE) |
| Review MAP weekly and flag slippage | Weekly | SE |

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Procurement compression is the SE's secret weapon. The SE who can shave 6 months off a procurement cycle is worth more to the business than the SE who wins the technical evaluation — because without the first, the second doesn't matter.
