#### 2.1.1 Scoring Deal Quality in the First 15 Minutes

You don't need a 60-minute discovery call to know whether a deal is worth your investment. You need 15 minutes and five questions. The best SEs in the industry make their first resource-allocation decision within the first quarter-hour of engagement — not by gut feel, but by running a rapid quality score that separates real opportunities from pipeline theatre.

1. **Question 1: "What's happening in your business that made you take this meeting?"** This is the single most diagnostic question in presales. A real opportunity produces a specific answer: "Our data pipeline breaks every time the schema changes, and it's costing us 6 hours of engineering time per incident." A pipeline theatre opportunity produces a vague answer: "We're just exploring what's out there" or "My VP asked me to look at vendors." Specific pain with a quantifiable impact = high score. Vague exploration with no triggering event = low score. Note the difference between *exploring* (no urgency) and *evaluating* (urgency exists).

2. **Question 2: "Who else is involved in this decision?"** The answer tells you two things: whether the deal is single-threaded (dangerous) and whether you're talking to the right person. If the answer is "just me for now," the deal is either very early or politically orphaned. If the answer is "our VP of Engineering and our CISO are part of the evaluation committee," you have a structured buying process — which means the opportunity is real. The number and seniority of people involved is a direct proxy for deal seriousness.

3. **Question 3: "Have you evaluated solutions like ours before?"** Past evaluation behaviour predicts future evaluation behaviour. A prospect who looked at competitors 12 months ago and didn't buy is a different animal from a prospect evaluating for the first time. The first has established decision criteria, known objections, and potentially a failed implementation that created scar tissue. The second is a blank canvas. Both are valid opportunities — but they require completely different approaches. Knowing which one you're in prevents wasted effort.

4. **Question 4: "What does your timeline look like for making a decision?"** This is the urgency test. A prospect with a board mandate to have a solution in production by Q3 is a fundamentally different deal from a prospect who's "hoping to have something in place by year-end, maybe." The first has a forcing function. The second doesn't. Deals without forcing functions have an 80% probability of stalling, regardless of how strong your product is. Urgency is not something you create — it's something the prospect's business creates. You discover it or you discover its absence.

5. **Question 5: "Is there a budget allocated for this project?"** Ask it directly. SEs who avoid this question because it "feels too salesy" are giving themselves permission to invest weeks of effort in deals that have no funding. You don't need the exact number. You need one of three answers: "Yes, we've allocated budget" (green), "We're in the budget approval process" (yellow), or "We haven't discussed budget yet" (red). A red answer doesn't mean walk away — it means this deal needs commercial qualification before it gets technical investment.

**The 15-Minute Score:**

| Factor | Score 3 (Strong) | Score 2 (Moderate) | Score 1 (Weak) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Pain specificity | Quantified, urgent | Acknowledged but vague | "Just exploring" |
| Stakeholder breadth | 3+ people, includes decision-maker | 2 people, evaluator level | Single contact, junior |
| Evaluation history | First time or active re-evaluation | Looked before, no decision | Perpetual "explorer" |
| Timeline | Hard deadline with business driver | General timeframe | "No rush" |
| Budget | Allocated or in approval | Not yet discussed but plausible | No budget conversation at all |

**Score 12–15:** Full investment — this deal is real.
**Score 8–11:** Conditional investment — address the weak factors before going deep.
**Score 5–7:** Minimal investment — this needs qualification, not a demo.

> **War Story:** An SE received 4 new deal requests on a Monday morning. Instead of accepting all 4, she ran a 15-minute qualification call on each one. Scores: 14, 11, 7, 6. She invested fully in the 14 and the 11, ran a light qualification process on the 7, and told the AE on the 6 to "come back when there's a champion and a timeline." By quarter end, the 14 and the 11 closed. The 7 stalled and eventually died. The 6 never progressed. She'd saved 80+ hours of effort by scoring quality on day one.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who treats every new deal as equally deserving. They run full discoveries, build custom demos, and prepare detailed architectures for deals scoring 5–7. By mid-quarter, they're exhausted, their calendar is full, and their high-quality deals are being starved of attention. The 14-scoring deal that should have gotten their best work got their leftover energy instead. It slipped to next quarter. Equal effort is not fair — it's wasteful.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you assess whether a new deal is worth your full investment?"
A strong answer describes a rapid qualification framework with specific criteria. A weak answer says "I give every deal my best effort."

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Deal scoring isn't about being selective for its own sake. It's about investing your finite bandwidth where it generates the highest return. This is portfolio management, not laziness.
