#### 2.4.1 Tiering Your Deal Portfolio

You cannot invest equally in every deal and expect above-average results. The math doesn't allow it. If you have 12 active deals and 45 available hours per week for deal work, that's 3.75 hours per deal per week. For a complex enterprise deal that needs discovery, solution design, demo preparation, and POC execution, 3.75 hours is nothing. Your best deals are being starved because your worst deals are getting the same attention.

Tiering is the discipline of explicitly categorising your deals by investment worthiness and allocating your time accordingly.

1. **Tier 1: All-In (2–3 deals).** These are your highest-probability, highest-value deals. Strong champion, confirmed budget, clear timeline, strong technical fit. These deals get your best work: custom demos, deep solution design, proactive follow-ups, executive briefing preparation. Rule: Tier 1 deals get 60% of your time.

2. **Tier 2: Strategic Investment (3–4 deals).** These are real opportunities with one or two gaps — maybe the champion isn't fully confirmed, or the budget is in process, or the timeline is soft. These deals get solid work but not bespoke: tailored (not custom) demos, standard discovery depth, responsive (not proactive) follow-up. Rule: Tier 2 deals get 30% of your time.

3. **Tier 3: Monitor (3–5 deals).** These are early-stage, exploratory, or low-confidence deals. They might become real, but they're not there yet. These deals get minimal SE investment: attend meetings if scheduled, provide standard materials, but no custom preparation. Rule: Tier 3 deals get 10% of your time. If a Tier 3 deal doesn't progress to Tier 2 within 4 weeks, close it or hand it off.

4. **Re-tier weekly.** Deals move. A Tier 2 deal where the champion just got executive sponsorship becomes Tier 1. A Tier 1 deal where the budget just got frozen becomes Tier 3. Review your tier assignments every Monday morning. If you're not moving deals between tiers regularly, either your tiering criteria are too loose or your deals aren't progressing.

5. **Communicate your tiering to your AE.** AEs need to know where their deals stand in your portfolio: "I've tiered our deal portfolio for this quarter. [Company A] and [Company B] are my Tier 1 — they're getting full investment. [Company C] is Tier 2 — solid effort but not bespoke. [Company D] and [Company E] are Tier 3 — I'll attend meetings but won't do custom preparation unless something changes. If you want to move a deal up, help me close the qualification gaps." This transparency prevents conflict and gives the AE agency to improve deal quality.

> **War Story:** An SE was running 15 deals simultaneously and treating them all as Tier 1. Her average prep time per deal was 45 minutes per week. She was exhausted, her demo quality had dropped, and her technical win rate had fallen to 22%. Her manager required her to tier: 3 Tier 1, 4 Tier 2, 8 Tier 3. The result: her Tier 1 deals got 5–6 hours per week each. Her demo quality skyrocketed. Two of the three Tier 1 deals closed that quarter. Her technical win rate climbed to 50%. Total revenue influenced: higher than the previous quarter despite managing fewer deals intensively. She didn't become a better SE. She became a better allocator.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who refuses to tier because "every customer deserves my best effort." They're not wrong morally — but they're wrong strategically. Equal effort across unequal deals produces equally mediocre results. The customer on your Tier 1 deal who gets 3 hours of your time instead of 6 because you're spreading yourself across 15 deals is the customer being harmed by your egalitarianism.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you manage your time across multiple deals?"
A strong answer describes a tiering system with specific criteria and time allocation rules. A weak answer says "I prioritise based on what's most urgent" — which is reactive, not strategic.

**Practical Reference: The Weekly Tier Review Template**

| Deal | Company | Value | Champion | Budget | Timeline | Tech Fit | Score | Tier | Time Allocation |
|------|---------|-------|----------|--------|----------|----------|-------|------|----------------|
| | | | Y/N | Y/N | Hard/Soft/None | Strong/Mod/Weak | /20 | 1/2/3 | hrs/week |

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Tiering is not about working less. It's about working smarter. The discipline to under-invest in low-probability deals is what creates the capacity to over-invest in high-probability ones.
