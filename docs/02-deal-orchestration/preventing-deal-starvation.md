#### 2.4.4 Preventing Your Best Deals From Being Starved

The paradox of enterprise presales: your best deals — the ones with the highest probability and the largest value — are the ones most likely to be under-serviced. Not because you don't care about them. Because everyone else's urgency steals your attention. The Tier 3 deal that needs a "quick demo tomorrow." The AE who needs "just 30 minutes" for a call prep. The product team that needs feedback "by end of day." Each interruption is individually harmless. Collectively, they starve your best deals of the deep work they require.

Deal starvation is the silent killer of SE revenue contribution. You won't see it in your CRM. You'll see it in your win rate — specifically, the deals you lost not because the competition was better, but because you didn't give your best deal your best effort.

1. **Recognise the starvation symptoms.** Your Tier 1 deal prep happens at 10 PM because your daytime was consumed by lower-priority work. Your demo for the most important deal is "good enough" instead of "exceptional." Your follow-up takes 3 days instead of 24 hours because you were putting out fires. Your executive briefing slides are repurposed from a previous deal instead of customised. If any of these are happening, your best deals are starving.

2. **Block "deep work" time and defend it aggressively.** For every Tier 1 deal, block a specific 2–3 hour window each week for concentrated preparation. Label the block with the deal name on your calendar. When someone tries to schedule over it: "That time is reserved for [Company A] executive briefing prep. Can we find an alternative time?" This isn't being difficult. This is being disciplined. The SE who can't protect 2 hours for their most important deal is managing their calendar with the same discipline they'd criticise in a prospect's project management.

3. **Quantify the cost of starvation.** When you're tempted to skip your Tier 1 prep for a Tier 3 request, do the math. Your Tier 1 deal is worth $500K. Your Tier 3 deal is worth $75K with a 20% win probability (expected value: $15K). The 2 hours you'd spend on the Tier 3 demo would be better invested in the Tier 1 executive briefing — where 2 hours of preparation could be the difference between a compelling presentation and a forgettable one. This isn't speculation. Over a career, the SEs who consistently invest their best effort in their best deals produce 2–3x the revenue of SEs who spread effort equally.

4. **Make your best deals your default mode.** Your default activity — what you work on when nothing is scheduled — should be advancing your Tier 1 deals. Not email. Not Slack. Not CRM updates. Your Tier 1 deal always has a next action, and that action should be what you do first, every day. Everything else fits around it.

5. **Report starvation to your manager.** If structural issues are starving your best deals — too many deals assigned, too many non-deal requests, too many internal obligations — raise it explicitly: "My Tier 1 deals are getting 4 hours per week each. Based on their complexity, they need 6–8. I'm being pulled into [specific low-value activities] that are consuming the difference. Can we discuss how to protect my bandwidth on my top opportunities?" This isn't complaining. This is managing up — and it's a Senior SE responsibility.

> **War Story:** An SE was running a $1.1M Tier 1 deal alongside 9 other deals. Her Tier 1 deal required a custom architecture review for the prospect's CTO — a document that would take 5–6 hours to produce well. Over 3 consecutive days, she got pulled into: an emergency demo for a Tier 3 deal (the AE's manager pressured her), a product feedback session with engineering, and a team lunch-and-learn she was presenting. By Thursday, she'd spent zero hours on the architecture review. She produced it Friday afternoon in 2 hours — a rushed version that was "fine" but not compelling. The CTO's feedback: "Your competitor's architecture document was more thorough." That document gap contributed to a competitive loss on a $1.1M deal. Three low-priority interruptions over three days cost her company seven figures.

> **Failure Mode:** The SE who operates on a "whoever asks first" model. Their time goes to whoever sends the first Slack message or schedules the first meeting. This isn't a time management strategy — it's the absence of one. The result is chronically starved Tier 1 deals and well-fed Tier 3 deals — an exact inversion of optimal resource allocation.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you protect your time for your most important deals?"
A strong answer describes specific techniques (calendar blocking, tiering, trade-off communication, manager escalation). A weak answer describes being "really busy" without demonstrating strategic prioritisation.

**Practical Reference: The Deal Starvation Prevention Checklist**

| Check | Healthy | Starved |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Tier 1 prep time per week | 5–8 hours per deal | < 3 hours per deal |
| Follow-up response time | < 24 hours | > 48 hours |
| Demo/briefing quality | Customised, compelling | Repurposed, adequate |
| Deep work blocks on calendar | 2–3 per week, protected | None, or frequently overridden |
| Default activity | Tier 1 deal advancement | Email, Slack, ad-hoc requests |

**If 3+ rows show "Starved," your best deals are at risk. Act this week.**

🟡 **Mid-Level** — Your best deals deserve your best work. Not your leftover work. Not your late-night work. Your *best* work, during your *best* hours, with your *full* attention.
