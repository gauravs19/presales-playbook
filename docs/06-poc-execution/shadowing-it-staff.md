#### 6.3.3 Shadowing Their IT Staff to Find Hidden Objections

A Proof of Concept (POC) is a political process disguised as a technical evaluation. 

When you win the final 14-day bake-off, the CTO will smile, sign the $300k contract, and your AE will ring the gong. But six months later, the implementation fails because the Director of IT Operations actively hates your software and stonewalls the rollout. 

Why? Because during the POC, the Director of IT Operations felt their job was threatened by the automation you were selling, and they buried their objections instead of voicing them to the CTO.

A Master-Class SE uses the 14-day technical validation as an intelligence-gathering mission to find the buried bodies. 

**The Shadowing Technique**
You must demand "Shadow Time" in the Mutual Success Plan. It is not enough to ask the prospect’s engineers how the testing is going on a 15-minute daily Zoom stand-up. You must physically or virtually sit next to them while they use the tool.

*The Approach:*
"We find that a 14-day POV is most effective when our SEs can sit virtually with your practitioners for 45 minutes on Day 3 and Day 10. We don't drive. You drive. We just want to watch how your team naturally interacts with the new UI to ensure it genuinely saves them time on their current workflow."

**What to Look For When Shadowing:**
1.  **The "Workaround" Mentality:** Do they export your beautiful, machine-learning-powered dashboard into Excel because "that's how we've always done it"? If they do, your value proposition just died. They aren't going to adopt the software. You must immediately intervene and teach them the native workflow.
2.  **The Silent Resenter:** Is there a senior sysadmin who refuses to log into the sandbox, rolls their eyes during the stand-ups, and constantly brings up the cost of switching? This person is not testing your software; they are building a business case for why their boss should reject it. You must identify them early and construct a "Champion as Hero" narrative (Section 5.2.3) tailored strictly for them.
3.  **The Missing Integration:** While shadowing, you notice they are copying and pasting UUIDs between your sandbox and an obscure internal billing system they never mentioned during discovery. You just uncovered a massive implementation risk. You must immediately escalate this to the project manager.

**Building the "Insider Threat" Dossier**
After every shadowing session, the SE must update the Account Executive. "The CTO wants to buy, but the lead DBA hates our indexing structure and is currently writing a memo to the VP of Engineering to kill the deal. We need a 1-on-1 with that DBA tomorrow to neutralize the technical threat."

> **War Story:** An SE at a network intelligence company spent 90 minutes virtually shadowing a network operations center (NOC) team during a POC. The team lead was incredibly quiet. The SE asked to see how the team lead categorized an alert. The lead opened three different terminal windows, ran two Python scripts, and manually updated a Jira ticket. The SE said, "What if our platform could automate those three terminal windows instantly?" The team lead visibly relaxed. He admitted, "My boss told me this tool was going to replace my job. If it just replaces the boring scripts... I'll back it." The SE found the hidden objection and saved a $1.2M deal. 

> **Failure Mode:** "The Hands-Off Validation." The SE provisions the sandbox, conducts a pristine 1-hour kickoff training, and then waits 14 days for the prospect to email them the "Pass" grade. The SE assumes silence means testing is going perfectly. The SE is blindsided when the prospect chooses the competitor because a junior analyst found the competitor's UI slightly easier to use. 

**Interview Angle:**
"During a major technical evaluation, how do you handle end-users who are resistant to adopting your platform?"
A strong answer is: "Resistance usually stems from fear of job replacement or the pain of learning a new workflow. I do not wait for the final readout to discover this. I mandate shadowing sessions midway through the POC. I sit with the resistant users, watch them work, and actively reframe the software not as a platform that replaces their expertise, but as a force multiplier that removes their most tedious manual tasks."

🟡 **Principal-Level** — You win the CTO with the ROI slide. You win the implementation by making the junior sysadmin feel safe. Shadow them.
