#### 6.5.4 Calling a POC Loss Early

A senior SE's primary metric of success is not how many POCs they win. It is how quickly they lose the ones they were never going to win anyway.

Account Executives are fundamentally optimists. They believe every deal can be saved. If a competitor has a feature you lack, the AE will ask if you can build it. If the prospect’s champion gets fired halfway through a 30-day sandbox, the AE will ask if you can train their replacement.

A Master-Class SE protects the pipeline by killing dying POCs early.

When do you pull the plug? The evaluation is dead, and you must formally recommend killing the deal, when you hit one of three conditions:

1.  **The Competitor Has Locked the Criteria**
    If halfway through your execution, you discover the prospect’s primary success criterion is a feature uniquely proprietary to your biggest competitor, you are executing a "Column Fodder" POC. They are only testing you because procurement mandates they evaluate two vendors. The technical team has already decided to buy the competitor. Do not spend three weeks pretending you can win. Kill it immediately.

2.  **The Executive Sponsor Leaves**
    If the VP of Engineering who allocated the $300k budget leaves the company on Day 10 of a 30-day evaluation, the evaluation is over. The new interim VP will freeze all Q4 spending. Do not let your AE convince you that "the remaining engineering team still really loves the tool." The engineers cannot buy the tool. Pause the sandbox until a new VP is hired.

3.  **The Technical Debt Wall**
    If on Day 2 of a POC you realize the prospect's legacy infrastructure is so brittle, undocumented, and customized that it would require 8 months of Professional Services to integrate your API, you are looking at a fundamentally unprofitable implementation. Even if you manage to duct-tape a successful POC together, they will churn in year one because the deployment will fail. It is the SE’s job to tell the AE, "We cannot sell them this platform until they modernize their database tier. They are not ready for us."

**The Hard "Pull the Plug" Conversation**
You must document your recommendation to the AE and Regional VP of Sales. 

"I am recommending we immediately kill the 30-day POC at Zenith Corp. During our technical discovery this morning, the lead architect admitted that their absolute requirement for production rollout is a native integration with a proprietary main-frame protocol we do not support, and our product team confirmed it is not on the 12-month roadmap. Zenith Corp is currently evaluating Competitor X, who built that protocol natively three years ago. We cannot technically win this evaluation without misleading the prospect, and continuing the sandbox consumes 40 hours of my capacity that should be deployed on our tier-1 pipeline."

> **War Story:** An SE at a cybersecurity startup was deployed on a massive multi-month evaluation for a federal agency. Three weeks in, the SE realized the agency’s internal legacy tech stack was so outdated that the SE’s modern cloud sensors physically could not deploy on 80% of their servers. The AE begged the SE to "just test the 20% that works." The SE refused, escalating to the CRO: "If we sell them this, they will sue us for breach of contract in 6 months when it doesn't deploy." The CRO killed the evaluation, and the SE was lauded for saving the company from a disastrous legal and resourcing catastrophe. 

> **Failure Mode:** "The Martyr SE." The SE realizes a deal is unwinnable in week two, but grinds through an 80-hour week to manually construct an unrealistic Proof of Concept, hoping the AE can just discount the software enough to win anyway. The SE burns out completely over a prospect that was structurally impossible to close.

**Interview Angle:**
"Describe a time you recommended walking away from a massive opportunity in the middle of a technical evaluation."
A strong answer is: "My job is to qualify technically. Qualification doesn't end after discovery; it continues during the POC. When I uncovered an insurmountable architectural roadblock that our platform could not solve without millions in custom engineering, I immediately engaged my AE and Sales Leadership. We formally disengaged from the evaluation, saving 120 hours of Presales capacity that I immediately redirected to a highly-qualified tier-1 close."

🟡 **Principal-Level** — Stop trying to save dead deals. Return your time to the pipeline.
