#### 6.5.2 When the Prospect Moves the Goalposts

You established the Mutual Success Plan. You defined three mandatory "pass/fail" technical criteria. On day 13, you successfully accomplished all three. 

On day 14, the prospect's evaluating engineering team says, "This is great. But our VP of Security just reviewed the project and said we also need native integration with CyberArk before we can approve the purchase. Can we test that next week?"

The goalposts just moved. 

If you say yes, you signal that your evaluation criteria are meaningless and that your technical time is free. If you say no, the evaluating engineers will claim you are uncooperative. 

A Master-Class SE uses a technique called **The Commercial Pivot** to freeze the goalposts.

**The Commercial Pivot**
When a prospect moves the goalposts after the initial criteria have been met, you must immediately pivot the conversation away from the technical sandbox and directly onto the commercial contract. 

You no longer solve the problem with engineering; you solve it with procurement.

*The Execution:*
"We can absolutely validate the CyberArk integration. However, as we formally proved the three mandatory criteria from our Mutual Success Plan today, the technical evaluation phase is officially concluded. 

I will have our API architect construct a 2-hour virtual whiteboard session on Monday to prove the CyberArk architecture. In parallel, because we hit the 3 core criteria, [Account Executive Name] will be sending the commercial contract to your procurement team this afternoon so we can begin the redlining process. We can make the CyberArk integration a formal, contractual contingency for final signature."

**Why this works:**
1.  **You closed the technical evaluation.** You did not say, "We are extending the POC." You unequivocally stated that the POC is over.
2.  **You called their bluff.** If the CyberArk integration is truly a mandatory requirement for purchase, they will happily review the commercial contract while you validate the architecture. If the CyberArk request was just a delay tactic because they don't actually have the budget approved, their procurement team will reject the contract. 
3.  **You protected your time.** You did not agree to spend 40 hours building a custom integration in a sandbox. You agreed to a 2-hour whiteboard session.

**The "Infinite Evaluation" Trap**
Many AEs are terrified of upsetting the prospect. They will beg the SE to "just do this one last thing" to secure the deal. 

The SE must hold the line. An SE who agrees to an infinite evaluation trains the prospect that the software vendor is subservient. If you are subservient during a free POC, they will expect 24/7 free consulting after they sign the $300k contract. 

> **War Story:** An SE for a data streaming platform proved their core ingestion speed over a 30-day POC. On the final day, the prospect added a completely new requirement: "We need our custom front-end team to build three dashboards on top of your API before we sign." The SE's AE panicked and agreed to extend the POC by an entire month. The prospect's front-end team took six weeks, built terrible dashboards, and blamed the vendor's API for the poor performance. The deal stalled for a year. The SE should have invoked the Commercial Pivot, locking the technical win and forcing the dashboard validation into a post-signature implementation phase.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Moving Finish Line." The SE completes 5 requirements. The prospect adds 2. The SE completes those. The prospect adds 3 more. The SE is trapped in a loop of proving endless edge-cases because neither the SE nor the AE had the backbone to formally shut down the sandbox.

**Interview Angle:**
"You hit all the success criteria in a POC, but the prospect asks to test one more major feature before buying. How do you respond?"
A strong answer is: "I utilize the Commercial Pivot. I acknowledge the value of the new feature but firmly close the technical evaluation phase. I offer to validate the new request via a whiteboard architecture session or a contractual contingency, but I mandate that the commercial procurement process begins immediately in parallel. If they refuse to begin the commercial process, I know the new technical request is actually a stall tactic for a lack of budget."

🟡 **Principal-Level** — When the goalposts move, the evaluation is over. The rest is negotiation.
