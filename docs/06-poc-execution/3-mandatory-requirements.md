#### 6.2.2 The 3-Mandatory-Requirements Rule

The fastest way to stall a technical evaluation is to accept a prospect’s spreadsheet containing 120 "Critical Requirements" for the POC. 

If you accept that spreadsheet, you are no longer a trusted advisor determining if the platform solves their business pain. You are a glorified human software-testing bot. You will spend six weeks checking boxes, and at the end of it, the prospect will tell you, "You only hit 115 out of 120. Your competitor hit 117. We are going with them."

You lost on a technicality that had zero bearing on the actual business outcome. 

**The 3-Requirements Framework**
A Master-Class SE dictates the rules of engagement. When a prospect hands you a massive spreadsheet of requirements, you must pivot the conversation.

*The Re-frame:* "We’re happy to review this exhaustive list of features post-sale during implementation. However, to ensure we don’t waste 30 days of your engineers' time testing hundreds of micro-features, we require that every POV is scoped to exactly **1 to 3 mandatory success criteria.** These are the three ‘Make or Break’ business outcomes that, if proven true, will justify the $300k investment to your CIO."

By enforcing this boundary, you achieve the following:
1.  **You compress the timeline.** It takes 14 days to prove 3 massive workflows. It takes 90 days to prove 120 micro-features.
2.  **You smoke out false urgency.** If the prospect cannot immediately articulate the top 3 critical business pains they are trying to solve, they do not have a real project. They are just window-shopping.
3.  **You secure the Technical Win.** When you inevitably prove the 3 mandatory criteria flawlessly, the evaluation is over. The prospect cannot move the goalposts.

**How to extract the 3 Requirements**
You cannot let the prospect's junior analysts define the 3 requirements; they will pick technical minutiae (e.g., "Must natively support custom CSS toggles"). You must align the criteria with the executive sponsor’s goals (e.g., "Must reduce MTTR of severity-1 incidents by 40%").

If the prospect fights back: "But our security team needs to validate the RBAC module before we buy!"
*The SE response:* "We completely understand. Our RBAC module is deployed at five tier-1 banks. I will provide your security team with our SOC2 report and a pre-recorded 10-minute deep-dive video of the RBAC configuration today. However, we will dedicate the actual live POC bandwidth exclusively to proving the 40% reduction in MTTR, as that is the metric your CIO told us was critical to Q3 funding."

**The Mutual Success Plan Integration**
Once the AE, the SE, and the prospect’s Economic Buyer agree on the exactly 3 mandatory criteria, they are locked into the **Mutual Success Plan** (covered in Section 6.3). Nothing else is tested.

> **War Story:** An SE at an identity-management vendor was handed a 300-point RFP spreadsheet for a POC. He refused to execute it. He sat down with the prospect's VP of Identity and said, "If we hit all 300 points, will you buy?" The VP said, "Yes." The SE countered, "If we only hit 3 points, but those 3 points allow you to fully automate your 14-day manual employee offboarding process—saving you $2M in compliance fines—will you buy?" The VP paused, then agreed. The SE defined those 3 criteria, executed the POC in 8 days, and closed a massive, high-margin deal. 

> **Failure Mode:** "Death by Requirements." The SE accepts the 120-point spreadsheet to please the prospect. On day 45, the prospect adds 15 new requirements to the list. The SE sighs and keeps testing. The deal never closes. 

**Interview Angle:**
"A prospect provides you with a 50-point checklist they want validated during a 30-day POC. What is your strategy?"
A strong answer is: "I refuse the checklist as the basis for the live evaluation. I explain that a successful Proof of Value is an executive-level experiment, not a QA session. I work directly with the business sponsor to distill that massive list down to exactly 1 to 3 critical business metrics that definitively prove our ROI. The remaining 47 points can be handled asynchronously via documentation, references, or post-sale implementation."

🟡 **Principal-Level** — He who defines the testing criteria wins the evaluation. Never accept a competitor's spreadsheet.
