#### 6.1.1 The True Cost of a Free POC

In the early stages of a tech company’s growth, offering "Free Proof of Concepts" (POCs) is a common strategy to build market share. However, as the product matures and deal sizes enter the enterprise tier ($250k+ ARR), the "Free POC" transforms from a growth engine into a silent killer of margin and deal velocity.

When an Account Executive (AE) happily tells you, "Great news! They agreed to a free 30-day POC!", they are often celebrating a massive strategic failure. 

To a prospect, "free" means "zero risk." And when a prospect has zero risk, they have zero urgency.

**The Invisible Costs of "Free"**

1.  **The Priority Deficit:**
    If a CTO has not spent a single dollar on a POC, it ranks at the absolute bottom of their team’s priority list. When your SE asks the prospect's data engineering team to configure the necessary network infrastructure to test your product, the data engineering team will ignore you. Why? Because their boss hasn't tied any financial capital to your success. 

2.  **The Infinite Scope Creep:**
    Because the POC is free, the prospect feels no pressure to finalize testing. A "30-day POC" routinely stretches into 60 or 90 days. "Can we test just one more data connector?" they will ask entirely consequence-free. You are now providing free tier-1 consulting.

3.  **The Devaluation of Your Software:**
    When you give away your most valuable asset—your product and the time of your senior Solutions Engineers—for free, you implicitly tell the prospect that your product is a commodity. You destroy leverage before the final pricing negotiation even begins.

**The Solution:**
You must train your AEs to treat POCs not as a favor you grant to the prospect to win their business, but as a mutual investment of massive resources that must be earned. 

> **War Story:** An enterprise software vendor offered a free 45-day POC to a massive retail bank. The bank happily accepted. The vendor's SE spent 80 hours configuring a custom demo environment and integrating it with the bank's legacy CRM. Three weeks into the "POC," the bank's project sponsor stopped returning emails. Six weeks later, the sponsor admitted, "We just wanted to see what the modern UI was like to help us draft an RFP for next year. We had no budget." The SE burned 80 hours of highly-paid technical time because the AE failed to establish mutual risk.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Begging Sales Cycle." The AE and SE are so desperate for a logo that they offer a free POC without demanding access to the ultimate economic buyer, a confirmed budget, or a mutually signed success plan. The prospect tests the software lazily and eventually ghosts the vendor.

**Interview Angle:**
"Tell me about a time you pushed back on an AE who wanted to offer a free POC."
A strong answer is: "A free POC without strict governance is just free consulting. I refused to execute a free POC for a telecom client until the AE secured a meeting with the VP of Infrastructure to explicitly align the POC outcome with a defined, funded Q3 initiative. If the VP wouldn't give us 30 minutes, they weren't going to give us $300k."

🟡 **Senior-Level** — Free is the most expensive word in enterprise sales.
