#### 6.3.1 Running the Daily Stand-Up Without Becoming Free Consulting

Once a Proof of Concept (POC) goes live, the single greatest threat to your evaluation is the "Silent Prospect." 

If your SE hands over the sandbox credentials, sets a calendar invite for 14 days later, and tells the prospect, "Let me know if you need anything!", you have already lost the deal. The prospect will get distracted by a production outage, test the software for a total of 12 minutes on day 13, and decide "it was too hard to use."

A Master-Class SE forces a cadence. The most effective cadence is the **15-Minute Daily Stand-up.**

However, this daily stand-up is incredibly dangerous if run poorly. If the SE acts like a Helpdesk agent answering "How do I click this button?" questions for 45 minutes, the SE has become unpaid technical support.

**The Rules of the POC Stand-up:**

1.  **It is mandatory, and it is 15 minutes.** 
    If the prospect's testing team cannot commit to a 15-minute daily sync, they are not actually evaluating your software. Kill the POC before it starts. The agenda must remain rigid: 
    - What did you test yesterday?
    - What are you testing today?
    - What is blocking you? 

2.  **You do not click the buttons.**
    During the stand-up, the prospect will inevitably share their screen and say, "I'm stuck trying to connect the Snowflake database. Can you just do it for me?" 
    *Action:* Never take keyboard control. If you configure the software for them, you prove that the software requires an expensive consultant to run. You must verbally guide them to the documentation or the UI button. *They* must experience the ease of use.

3.  **You tie every block back to the Success Criteria.**
    If the prospect says, "We're stuck trying to customize the colors of the reporting dashboard," you must check the Mutual Success Plan (Section 6.2.2). If "custom dashboard colors" is not one of the 3 mandatory success criteria, you immediately defer it. 
    *The Re-frame:* "I can absolutely send you the documentation on CSS customization after the call. However, looking at our timeline, today was scheduled to validate the latency metric. Are we still on track to ingest the test dataset this afternoon?"

> **War Story:** An SE was running a 14-day POV for a massive retail brand. On day 3, the prospect's lead engineer missed the 15-minute daily stand-up. The SE emailed him. No response. On day 4, the engineer missed the stand-up again. The SE did not wait. The SE instantly escalated to the Account Executive, who immediately called the Economic Buyer (the VP). "Your lead engineer has missed two daily syncs. Are we pausing this evaluation?" The VP was furious—not at the vendor, but at his own engineer. The lead engineer never missed another stand-up, and the POV finished 2 days early.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Subservient Stand-up." The SE allows the 15-minute stand-up to morph into a 60-minute daily training session where the prospect assigns the SE homework ("Can you write this regex for us by tomorrow?"). The SE is now a free employee of the prospect.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you manage a prospect who becomes unresponsive in the middle of a 30-day POC?"
A strong answer is: "Unresponsiveness is prevented by structure. I never start a POC without a mandated 15-minute daily or every-other-day stand-up agreed upon in the Mutual Success Plan. If the prospect misses two of those stand-ups, I immediately kill the technical work and have my AE escalate to the executive sponsor. If the sponsor doesn't care that their team isn't testing, the deal is dead anyway, and I need my time back."

🟡 **Senior-Level** — A daily stand-up is not a status update; it is an accountability mechanism to ensure the prospect is earning your time.
