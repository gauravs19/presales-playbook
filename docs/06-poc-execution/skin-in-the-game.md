#### 6.1.2 The "Skin in the Game" Principle (Paid POCs)

The most effective strategy to counter the failures of the "Free POC" is forcing the prospect to invest political, temporal, and financial capital before the technical engagement begins. 

This is the **"Skin in the Game" Principle**. A paid POC completely changes the psychology of the evaluation. 

When a prospect pays for a POC, three magical things happen:
1. **The Executive Sponsor engages.** If a VP signs off on a $15,000 POC, they will personally ensure that their team completes the testing on time. Their budget and reputation are now attached to the outcome.
2. **The "Scope" becomes a rigid contract.** A prospect will rarely ask to test "just one more feature" if that feature isn't listed in the paid SOW (Statement of Work) because they know it will trigger a change order and delay the results they paid for.
3. **The "Tech Win" forces the "Commercial Win."** If a prospect is willing to spend $15k to test a platform, they possess the $300k necessary to buy it. You eliminate tire-kickers entirely.

**How to Position a Paid POC without Losing the Deal**

AEs and SEs often fear that asking for $15,000 to test the software will insult the prospect. The key is in the framing. You are not charging them to *test* the software; you are charging them for *enablement and risk-mitigation*. 

*The Narrative Framing:*
"We treat our POCs as the first 30 days of your successful implementation. We don't just hand you a sandbox; we align our Senior Architects to integrate your live data pipelines, train your engineering team on best practices, and build the first three production-ready dashboards for your executive review. Because this requires intense, dedicated resources from our top tier, we charge a nominal $15,000 onboarding fee. However, if the platform proves the ROI we discussed, that $15k is fully credited against your year-one subscription."

**The "Credit Toward Purchase" Mechanism**
This is the golden rule of Paid POCs. Fully credit the POC price against the final annual contract. This completely neutralizes the financial objection. It proves to the prospect that you are confident they will buy.

> **War Story:** An SE at a massive data warehousing startup noticed their POCs were running 90+ days because their prospects’ DBA teams kept deprioritizing the integration work. The startup mandated that all enterprise POCs required a $20k fee, fully creditable. The DBA teams immediately stopped ghosting the startup. Why? Because the CTO had just spent $20k of their quarterly budget, and the CTO was demanding weekly updates on the ROI. The start-up's POC conversion rate doubled.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Uncredited Paid POC." Charging a prospect $25k to test a platform, but refusing to credit it against the final purchase price. The prospect views this as double-dipping and will often angrily cancel the evaluation.

**Interview Angle:**
"If a Fortune 500 company demands a free, custom POC, how do you handle it?"
A strong answer is: "I educate my AEs on the 'Skin in the Game' principle. I refuse to execute a 40-hour technical validation until the prospect either agrees to a nominal, creditable paid POC, or explicitly commits massive temporal capital—like a hardlined 14-day timeline with daily required check-ins with their VP of Engineering."

🟡 **Senior-Level** — A prospect who refuses to invest $15k in a paid POC does not have $250k to buy the software.
