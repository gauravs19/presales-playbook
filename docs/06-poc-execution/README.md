# Section 6: POC Execution & Management

The Proof of Concept (POC) is the single most dangerous phase of the enterprise sales cycle. 

When executed correctly, a POC is a hyper-focused, timeline-bound technical validation that inevitably leads to signature. When executed poorly, it becomes an infinite, uncompensated consulting engagement that drains Sales Engineering resources, stalls the deal, and trains the prospect that your software is difficult to use.

A Master-Class SE recognizes that a POC is not a feature-testing exercise. It is a strictly governed risk-mitigation tool.

This section covers the strategic orchestration of complex technical validations:

*   **[6.1 The POC Philosophy](docs/06-poc-execution/true-cost-free-poc.md)**: Understanding the true cost of free work and when to refuse custom builds.
*   **[6.2 Structuring the POV (Proof of Value)](docs/06-poc-execution/poc-vs-pov.md)**: Shifting the framework from testing features ("Does it work?") to measuring impact ("Does it save money?").
*   **[6.3 The Mutual Success Plan](docs/06-poc-management/daily-standup.md)**: The iron-clad document that governs exactly how a POC starts, executes, and ends.
*   **[6.4 POC Defense and Rescue](docs/06-poc-management/technical-win-declaration.md)**: How to handle scope creep, silent prospects, and failing technical metrics mid-flight.

A POC is not the beginning of the relationship. It is the final boss fight. You do not enter it unless you know exactly how you are going to win.
