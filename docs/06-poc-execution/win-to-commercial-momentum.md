#### 6.4.2 Turning the Technical Win Into Commercial Momentum

The single greatest failure of the modern presales organization is the assumption that a "Technical Win" automatically creates a "Commercial Win." 

The SE flawlessly configures the software. The prospect’s lead engineer gives a formal thumbs-up (Section 6.4.1). The SE updates Salesforce, marks the POC as "Successful," and immediately starts working on the next customer’s pipeline. 

Two months later, the Account Executive loses the deal because the CFO vetoes the purchase order. 

Why? Because the SE proved the software worked technically, but the AE failed to convert that technical proof into a compelling commercial case for the C-Suite. 

A Master-Class SE does not just throw the Technical Win over the fence to the AE and walk away. The SE actively arms the AE with the weapons they need to navigate procurement.

**The Post-POC Executive Summary**
The prospect’s evaluating engineering team does not sign contracts. The CFO signs contracts. The CFO was not in your 14-day technical sandbox. The CFO does not care about API latency or dark mode. 

The CFO cares about exactly three things:
1.  How much does this cost?
2.  How much money does this save us (or make us)?
3.  When will we see that return?

The SE must translate the deeply technical results of the POC into a 1-page **Executive Summary** that the prospect’s champion can hand directly to the CFO.

**Structure of the Executive Summary:**
*   **The Baseline Problem (Before State):** "Prior to the evaluation, Q3 data indicated that your DevOps team spent an average of 14 hours per incident relying on manual log aggregation, costing an estimated $42,000 per severity-1 outage."
*   **The Proved Value (After State):** "During the 14-day Proof of Value (August 1st - 15th), we loaded a native subset of your production data into our platform. Your lead engineer, [Name], validated that the platform automatically correlated the root cause in 12 minutes."
*   **The Financial Impact (ROI):** "If applied globally, this 98% reduction in mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) projects an annualized savings of $1.2M in engineering hard costs and SLA penalties."
*   **The Technical Recommendation:** "Based on these validated metrics, the internal engineering evaluation team formally recommends proceeding with the commercial implementation."

**The Internal "Handoff to Sales" Meeting**
Before that Executive Summary is ever sent to the prospect, the SE must hold a harsh internal sync with their own Account Executive. 

The SE is uniquely positioned to identify the commercial risks the AE missed because the SE spent 14 days in the trenches with the prospect's IT team.

*Questions the SE must force the AE to answer:*
*   "I know the CTO likes the software, but while shadowing the sysadmins, they told me they are actively trying to renew their contract with our competitor for a 50% discount. Have you confirmed the competitor is actually being displaced?"
*   "Our Mutual Success Plan was predicated on them deploying 400 agents, but during the POC they only tested 10. Do you actually have a hard commitment for a 400-agent tier, or are they going to downgrade at the final hour?"

By forcing these hard commercial realities back onto the AE immediately after the Technical Win, the SE ensures the deal does not stall in the final mile of procurement.

> **War Story:** An SE for a data analytics platform spent three weeks running a highly complex POC for a multinational logistics firm. The SE proved the platform could query 50TB of data in under 2 seconds. The prospect's data analysts were thrilled. They declared a massive Technical Win. The AE sent the contract for $450k. The prospect's CFO rejected it immediately. The CFO explained, "Our current clunky system takes 4 hours, and it's free. Your system takes 2 seconds, and it costs $450k. My team can afford to wait 4 hours." The SE proved an incredible technical capability (speed), but the AE never mapped that speed to a commercial metric the CFO cared about (e.g., millions saved in optimized truck routing). The deal died.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Siloed SE." The SE completes the final technical readout, logs off the Zoom call, and tells the AE, "Good luck with pricing!" The AE, lacking the technical vocabulary to defend the high price tag, immediately discounts the software by 40% when the prospect's procurement team pushes back. 

**Interview Angle:**
"Once you have successfully proven the software works during a POC, what is your next step?"
A strong answer is: "The technical win is useless without business alignment. I immediately draft an Executive Summary translating our specific technical achievements during the sandbox into hard ROI dollar values based on the initial discovery. I then host a mandatory internal transition call with my AE to highlight any political roadblocks or implementation risks I uncovered from the practitioner level."

🟡 **Principal-Level** — You are not done when the software works. You are done when the CFO understands why the software is worth the price.
