#### 5.6.2 Peer Demo Audit

A baseball player cannot correct their own swing mechanism simply by standing at home plate and guessing what they did wrong. They need a hitting coach watching from the dugout, analyzing their hip rotation and bat speed. 

Similarly, an SE cannot identify their own verbal tics, crutch words ("Um," "Like," "So, yeah"), or narrative pacing errors while they are simultaneously navigating a complex UI and fielding live technical questions from a CIO.

To reach a Master-Class level, SEs must institutionalize the **Peer Demo Audit**.

**1. The "Observer" Role**
A Peer Demo Audit requires a second SE (or a technical AE) to sit silently on a live prospect call for the sole purpose of evaluating the primary SE's performance. The observer does not speak. They are not introduced as a participant to the prospect. They are a ghost analyzing your swing. 
*Action:* Build a culture on your presales team where requesting a Peer Audit is a sign of maturity, not weakness.

**2. The Audit Rubric (Objective Alignment)**
The observer must evaluate the demo using the exact same objective scoring rubric outlined in Section 5.6.1 (Talk-Time, Objection Handling, C.R.A.F.T. Execution). 
*Action:* A 10-minute debrief immediately following the call. The observer provides two pieces of highly specific feedback:
The single strongest moment of narrative execution.
The single moment where the SE lost the room (e.g., "From minute 14 to 22, the CTO checked his phone three times while you explained the RBAC configuration.")

**3. The "Crutch Word" Counter**
Junior SEs rely heavily on filler words when their brain is processing a next step in the UI. 
*Action:* The observer physically tallies every single time the SE says a specific phrase. "You said 'Does that make sense?' 14 times in 45 minutes." Or, "You started every sentence with 'Obviously'."
Once an SE is explicitly confronted with their own verbal tick count, they will instantly self-correct on the next call out of sheer embarrassment. 

**4. The "Dry-Run" Audit (The Safety Net)**
Before a massive $5M enterprise pitch, you do not test your narrative on the prospect. You test it on your peers.
*Action:* Schedule a 60-minute internal Dry-Run. Two senior SEs explicitly play the roles of the hostile technical stakeholders (e.g., the skeptical CISO and the aggressive DBA). They must intentionally interrupt the SE's narrative flow with the exact competitor traps outlined in Section 5.3.3.

**5. The Feedback Loop**
An audit is useless if the feedback is ignored. The SE must explicitly document the feedback and create an action plan.
*Action:* Add the feedback to the Demo Improvement Log (covered in Section 5.6.3). "Feedback: I failed to execute the 5-Minute Aha! rule. Next step: I will restructure my demo flow for AcmeCorp tomorrow to ensure the final predictive dashboard is shown within 120 seconds of screen sharing."

> **War Story:** An incredibly technical SE kept losing large enterprise deals. The feedback from AEs was that he was "too dry" and "too detailed." The SE fundamentally disagreed. He asked his manager to conduct a Peer Demo Audit. The manager sat silently on a 60-minute WebEx. Afterwards, the manager showed the SE the tally: The SE had spent 32 minutes exclusively discussing the underlying API pagination logic, and 0 seconds discussing the actual business pain the customer had revealed in discovery. The objective audit broke the SE's ego. He adopted the C.R.A.F.T. methodology and closed a $400k deal three weeks later.

> **Failure Mode:** "The Defensiveness Trap." When the observer provides constructive feedback ("You lost the room during the RBAC explanation"), the SE instantly defends their actions ("But I had to show that, because the competitor has it!"). Defensiveness guarantees that the SE will never improve, and peers will refuse to audit them in the future.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you process constructive criticism regarding your presentation skills?"
A strong answer is: "I actively solicit it. I schedule Peer Demo Audits with senior SEs because I know I have blind spots when presenting live. I request specific tallies of my crutch words and objective measurements of my talk-time, and I immediately institutionalize that feedback into a log to ensure I change my muscle memory for the next call."

🟡 **Senior-Level** — Only amateurs practice on their prospects. Professionals practice on their peers.
