#### 5.1.4 Choosing Live Demo vs. Guided Sandbox vs. Video

A live software demonstration is high-risk, high-cost, and hard to schedule. SEs default to the "live demo" because it feels like the established sales motion, but modern B2B buying has changed. If you only have one club in your bag (the live demo), you will slow down the sales cycle unnecessarily. 

Master-class presales professionals deploy different demonstration formats depending on the specific friction they are trying to solve in the deal cycle.

**1. The "Live Demo" (High Stakes, High Value)**
*   **When to use:** Executive briefings, final technical validations, highly customized workflows, or competitive bake-offs. 
*   **Why:** A live demo proves the software actually exists and performs as described in real-time. It allows the SE to pivot dynamically based on live questions ("Hold on, what if the user logs in from an unknown IP?"). You use a live demo when you need to build absolute trust and prove capability under fire.
*   **The Trap:** Do not use a live demo for generic, top-of-funnel "Platform Overviews." It is too expensive (SE time + AE time) for an unqualified prospect.

**2. The Micro-Video (Asynchronous Velocity)**
*   **When to use:** Following up after an initial discovery call, answering a specific technical question via email, or equipping a champion to sell internally.
*   **Why:** Executive buyers share videos; they do not share PDFs. If an AE asks you a technical question from a prospect ("Can the system export audit logs to Splunk?"), do not write a 3-paragraph email. Record a 90-second Loom video showing exactly how to configure the Splunk integration, explain the value, and send the link.
*   **The Trap:** Do not make the video generic. Start the video by explicitly stating the prospect's name and their specific problem. "Hi Sarah, following our call Tuesday, here is exactly how your team will export data to Splunk..." 

**3. The Interactive Sandbox (The Leave-Behind)**
*   **When to use:** Mid-cycle technical validation, or when selling to developer/practitioner personas who notoriously hate being "sold to" and prefer to click around themselves.
*   **Why:** Products like Navattic or Reprise allow you to send a click-through, gated clone of your software without spinning up a live Proof of Concept (POC) environment. Practitioners can test the UI on their own time.
*   **The Trap:** Never send an unrestricted sandbox. A sandbox without a guide is a labyrinth. Always send a "Guided Tour" that forces them down the specific "Happy Path" you want them to see. If you just give them credentials to a blank environment, they will get confused, assume the software is hard to use, and ghost you.

**4. The "GIF in the Email" Strategy**
*   **When to use:** Reactivating a stalled deal.
*   **Why:** If a prospect goes dark, a text-based check-in email ("Just bubbling this up") is useless. Instead, take the single most impressive visual from your platform—a threat map lighting up in red, an AI bot auto-resolving a ticket, a beautiful dashboard—record it as a 5-second GIF, and embed it directly into the body of the email. They don't even have to click a link; it plays automatically. "John, I know you've been buried, but I just built this custom threat map for the AcmeCorp deal. Thought you'd want to see how we visualize lateral movement. Let me know if you have 15 minutes Friday."

> **War Story:** An SE supporting a high-velocity commercial patch was drowning in 15 generic "Harbor Tour" demos a week. He couldn't prep properly for the massive enterprise deals anymore. He spent one weekend recording five 3-minute, highly polished "Micro-Demos" covering the platform's core use cases. He mandated that AEs must send one of these videos to a prospect *before* requesting live SE time. If the prospect watched the video and still wanted to talk, they were highly qualified. If they didn't watch it, they weren't buying anyway. His live demo load dropped by 60%, allowing him to focus exclusively on multi-million dollar deals. 

> **Failure Mode:** The "Standard Deck First." The SE refuses to show the software until the prospect survives 30 minutes of PowerPoint slides detailing the company's funding history, logo slide, and generic market trends. By the time the SE switches to the browser, the prospect is exhausted.

**Interview Angle:**
"A prospect asks for a quick demo of how your reporting engine works. How do you respond?"
A strong answer is: "Instead of trying to schedule a live 30-minute WebEx with three different stakeholders, I will immediately record a 3-minute personalized Loom video demonstrating the exact report they asked for, send it asynchronously, and use that video to secure a deeper scoping call."

🟡 **Mid-Level** — A live demo is a sniper rifle. A recorded video is artillery. Use them appropriately.
