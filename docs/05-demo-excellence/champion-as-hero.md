#### 5.2.3 Making Your Champion the Hero of the Story

When an SE delivers a software demonstration, the natural instinct is to make the software the hero. "Look how powerful our AI is," they say. "Look how fast our database is." 

This is a fundamental mistake. Executives do not buy software because the software is great. They buy software to achieve a business outcome, secure a promotion, or avoid being fired.

If your software is the hero, your prospect is just a user. If your prospect is the hero, your software is their superpower.

A Master-Class SE explicitly casts their internal champion (the person advocating for the purchase inside the account) as the protagonist of the demonstration. 

**1. The "Promotion" Framing**
Before you log into the platform, explicitly tie the capabilities you are about to show to the champion’s personal or departmental goals. If their goal is to unify data architectures across three regions to impress the board, you frame the demo explicitly around that.
*Execution:* "Susan, you mentioned your mandate this year is to centralize compliance reporting for the board, so you don’t have to manually pull data from EMEA and LATAM. I’m going to show you exactly how this platform gives you that single pane of glass, so when you walk into the board meeting next month, you have the answers in 15 seconds."
*(You are not selling a dashboard. You are selling Susan's success in front of her board of directors).*

**2. Cast Their Team in the Demo**
A generic demo uses "User 1" and "Admin 2." A champion-centric demo uses the actual names of their team members that you uncovered during discovery. 
*Execution:* "So, your lead developer, Marcus, is trying to provision a new cluster. Instead of Marcus waiting three weeks for infrastructure to approve a Jira ticket, Marcus simply logs into this self-service portal..."
*(The software stops being a commodity; it becomes the exact tool Marcus uses to stop complaining to his boss).*

**3. "The Hero's Dashboard"**
Every enterprise platform has a high-level executive dashboard or reporting suite. You must personalize this specifically for the champion. 
*SE Action:* If you are selling to a VP of Sales Ops, you must build a custom dashboard in your demo environment titled `[Company Name] VP Sales Ops Command Center`, loaded with exactly the KPIs they care about (churn, pipeline, forecast). 
*Execution:* "When you log in at 8:00 AM, this is your control center. You don't have to ask your team for a status update; the platform tells you exactly which deals are at risk before your morning coffee."

**4. The "Enablement" Pivot**
A champion's biggest silent fear is that if they buy your software, they will be the one stuck configuring, managing, and troubleshooting it. They fear becoming the "Software Janitor."
*SE Action:* You must explicitly demonstrate how the software empowers them to delegate easily.
*Execution:* "Susan, right now, you are the bottleneck because only you know how to run these complex SQL queries. Watch how easily you can build a no-code parameterized workflow, click 'Share,' and instantly give your junior analysts the ability to pull this themselves securely. You are no longer writing queries; you are managing outcomes."

**5. Shielding the Champion in a Hostile Room**
Often, a champion brings you into a room full of hostile stakeholders who do not want to change their existing tools. If the hostile stakeholders start attacking the software ("We can just build this internally," or "This takes too long to load"), the SE must instinctively protect the champion. 
*Execution:* "That's a fair question on load times. Susan and I initially looked closely at that during scoping. Susan astutely pointed out that while a batch load takes three minutes here, it completely eliminates the three *days* your team currently spends manually reconciling the data downstream. Susan’s priority was accuracy over instant batching."
*(You have validated the attacker's question while shielding your champion by citing their exact strategic priority. You made Susan look brilliant in front of her peers).*

> **War Story:** An SE at an HR tech company was selling a massive enterprise deployment. The internal champion was a Director of TA who desperately wanted a promotion to VP, but was bogged down by manual interview scheduling. During the executive demo to the CHRO, the SE didn't say, "Here is our automated scheduler." He said, "Currently, Sarah's team spends 40% of their week playing email tag with candidates. By deploying this automation engine, Sarah instantly reallocates that 40% toward strategic employer branding—which I know is the CHRO's top OKR this year. Here is exactly how Sarah executes that pivot." The CHRO looked at Sarah, nodded, and approved the budget. Sarah got the VP title six months later. 

> **Failure Mode:** "The Tech Narcissist." The SE spends 45 minutes talking exclusively about the brilliant engineering of their proprietary architecture, completely ignoring the strategic goals of the person who brought them into the account. The champion silently realizes the SE is there to sell software, not to help them advance their career, and abandons the deal.

**Interview Angle:**
"How do you prepare for a demonstration when your primary contact (the champion) has to suddenly present the software to their CEO?"
A strong answer is: "I realize the CEO is evaluating my champion's decision-making, not just the software. I strip all technical jargon out of the demo and frame the entire narrative around how the platform specifically achieves the strategic business outcomes the champion promised the CEO."

🟡 **Senior-Level** — Software is a costume. Your prospect wants to put it on and be Superman. Hand them the cape.
